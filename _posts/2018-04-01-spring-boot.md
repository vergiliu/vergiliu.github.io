A good and relatively short intro to Spring Boot - especially easy as a step-by-step example is built, with things added as the books goes along.

Spring security and a good introduction on starter/initializer is also mentioned.
The Actuator chapter is worth reading especially if implementing something custom.
The CLI - which I'm guessing there aren't too many users is also presented at length.
Last chapter goes over DB migration which is a very important topic in itself and also fat JARs / deployable artifacts are glanced over.
Last appendixes (chapter) have a lot of information about the dependencies and configuration / properties, probably useful is migrating from Maven to Gradle.

The book got an extra half point for briefness and clarity.
