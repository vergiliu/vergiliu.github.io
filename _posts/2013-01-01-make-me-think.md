`Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug`
The "bible" of web usability in its second incarnation. A couple of ideas or take-aways from the book:

+ Make the site natural to the user and his actions
+ Build billboards not newspapers
+ Make stuff visible and easy to determine what's its function to the user
+ "Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of what's left"
+ Home page is really an important starting point in the design, although everybody wants to have its saying about it.
+ make clear what's the mission of the site, easily done through displaying a tagline (5-8 words)
+ make sure the home page conveys just the main objective of the site and not an in-depth review of what the site does
+ have a clear separation of the main tagline, categories, description, search and others
+ usability: testing earlier is better and cheaper than doing it at the very end of the project
+ to get a new perspective on the site you're building, you must test it
+ testing some parts by even 1 user is better than no testing at all
+ focus groups help establishing the target user group of the site before the design phase starts
+ try to involve different people from different teams in order to get more traction and involvement during the (usability) testing
+ ask the tester to do some specific tasks besides
+ After the walkthroughs review/go over the notes as soon as possible

Rating 5/5
