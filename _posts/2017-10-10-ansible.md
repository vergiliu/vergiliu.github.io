## Ansible:
#### Intro:
- ping/test all hosts in inventory file `ansible -m ping -i inventory.yaml all `
- you can define the default inventory file in your ~/.ansible.cfg or in the current folder ./ansible.cfg

```
[defaults]
hostfile = inventory.yaml
host_key_checking = False
```

- to run a command on a host defined in the inventory: `ansible -i inventory.yaml -m command -a uptime host_one `
    - the `-m command` part can be omitted as it's default
        - we can rewrite the command as `ansible -a uptime host_one`, as mentioned ansible.cfg defines the inventory file
        - the part after -m represents a _module_, so depending on the module being executed we can get different information returned
        	- `-m setup` can retrieve information about the host
        	- `-m ping` uses the _ping_ module to check if the host is reachable
    - add `-s` to sudo
- `yum: state=present name=git` in the playbook, will actually use the yum module
	- or _name={{our_package}}_ if in the **vars:** section we set _our_package: git_
	- `include: playbook.yaml our_package=nginx` because we can override the variable
	- vars can be used as custom input fields, such as one-off/custom passwords
- handlers - a special task that can be executed if it is registered as a change
	- they don't run in the given order, but in the order they are notified
- playbooks will stop when encountering the first error, unless `ignore_errors: true`
	- debug can be enabled in tasks with `debug: var=my_output`
- first `shell:pwd` then we define register as `register: pwd_output`, then we can use the variable as `{{pwd_output['output']}}`
	- we can filter the output/variable value by using either _failed_ or _success_ , e.g. `{{ variable_value\|failed }}`
* Sample playbook

```yaml
- name: Configure nginx
  hosts: docker
  sudo: True                              # JSON formatting is different
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      apt: name=nginx                     # [OR]
      shell: yum install -y nginx         # [OR]
      yum: state=present name=nginx       # [OR]
      service: state=started name=nginx

    - name: copy index.html
      template: src=templates/index.html.j2 dest=/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
mode=0644
```

*  YAML folding syntax, like this:

```yaml
- name: install nginx
  apt: >
      name=nginx
      update_cache=yes
```

* to get access to online docs `ansible-doc service`
* to use handlers, we need to `notify` an external task
    * handlers are ran only once, no matter how many times they are triggered, at the end of the playbook

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: update nginx config
    file: [...]
    notify: nginx restart

handlers:
  - name: nginx restart
    service: name=nginx state=restarted
```

* we can create templates in the `templates` folder, for example the nginx file will be called `templates/nginx.conf.j2` as it will use Jinja2 templating

```
server {
    [...]
    server_name {{ server_name }};
```
* The Inventory file(s)
    * we can specify hostnames, alternate ssh ports, user, private key file
    * ansible creates a special group for `all`
    * we can specify groups of groups w/ `:children`
    * we can use wildcards when specifying hostnames, for a "cattle vs. pets approach"
    * we can use per host / group variables

```
[prod]
server-http.example
server-https1.example zone=blue
server-https[2-6].example zone=red

[test]
virtual85

[all:vars]
ntp_host=time.us.world

[prod:vars]
db_user=packet
db_port=1521
```

#### Variables

* for better flexibility, vars can be set in files
    * ansible looks for host variable files in a directory called `host_vars` and group variable files in a directory called `group_vars`
* for external managed inventory (e.g. EC2) we can get or create a dynamic inventory script
* variables can be set in 1 or more locations
    * directly in the playbook by using a `vars` section
    * by specifying a `vars_files: - test.yml` section inside the playbook
    * in files adjacent to the inventory file(s)
* all tasks / executions' steps have a `changed` variable which is set to true/false depending on what that particular step did or didn't do

#### Facts
* before running any tasks, ansible collects *facts* about hosts: cpu, memory, disk info, and so on
* the `setup` module gets called automatically to gather facts, they are all stored in `ansible_facts`
    * any module can return ansible facts
* we can also define variables using `set_fact`
    * or we can use `register: snap_result` and then `set_fact snap={{snap_result.stdout}}` to store its _stdout_ value
* we also _always_ have available built-in variables:
    * `hostvars` all variables from all hosts; `{{ hostvars['somehost'].ansible_eth0.ipv4.address }}` with which we can determine information
    * `inventory_hostname` current host
    * `groups` - can be useful for multi host in same domain configs

    ```
    {% for host in groups.web %}
      server {{ host.inventory_hostname }} {{ host.ansible_default_ipv4.address }}:80
    {% endfor %}
    ```
* variables can be set on the command line using `-e var=value` when executing `ansible-playbook`
* precedence of variable definition is important: 1 `command line` 2 `in a yaml file` 3 `facts` 4 `defaults/main of role`

#### Playbooks
* flags: `--check`, `--list-tasks`, `--list-tags`, `--syntax-check`, `--list-hosts`, `--ask-become-pass`
* install `with_items`:

```yaml
- name: install nginx and libpq-dev
  apt:
      name: "{{item}}"
      state: present
      update_cache: yes
  become: true
  with_items:
      - libpq-dev
      - nginx
```

- `xip.io` for wilcard DNS publicly available, can be used for testing
- for tasks executed on the local machine (control) we can specify `local_action`
- we can disable gathering facts (and ssh in turn) by setting `gather_facts` to false/no
- running sequentially instead of parallel by setting `serial: 1`
- for all the Jinja2 templating more advanced features such as re-formatting, parsing, conditionals can be used
- `run_once` for database migrations and one-time stuff :D
- `with_fileglob` iterating over a set of files
- we can have _pre_ and _post_ - tasks, that will be triggered before/after others
- for pip we can pass a _requirements_ file as well
- for certain roles we can include requirements for sub-roles, so called _dependent_ roles
- iterating over items: `with_items`, `with_lines`, `with_dict`, `with_sequence`, `with_inventory_hostnames`, ...
- _include_ s - can be static and do different things depending on the place
    - or dynamic, depending of various variables/facts

```yaml
- include: Redhat.yml
when: ansible_os_family == 'Redhat'
- include: Debian.yml
when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
```

- Blocks - mechanism for grouping tasks, e.g. `- block - name: abc - name: def when: ansible_os_family == Debian`
    - we can have improved error handling with block constructs, by having `rescue` and `always` clauses, which are triggered only on particular situations
- the hosts in the playbook can be specified as a list or a pattern like `all` an union `groupa:groupb` or intersection `dev:&test`, ... or a couple of other set operations
- we can as well limit on which hosts we run the playbook(s) with `--limit`
- we can execute commands on the control host as well with `local_action`; we can further limit its actions by specifying `run_once`
- we can limit (read serialize) our actions, for example when adjusting members of a load balancer pool, by specifying `serial: 1`
    - to prevent situations where we break the LB config by removing all hosts, the `max_fail_percentage: 50` (50 or any other value) can be used
    - the somewhat-opposite of serial:1 can be achieved w/ `serial: 50%` (_since Ansible 2.2_)
- Running strategies: `linear` (default), `free` - in which new tasks are started on a host if previous steps have finished executing
- we can set up role dependencies, which run before the parent dependency using `dependencies: - role: ssl` for the web hosts which need SSL certs before installing the web server
- Vagrant support

#### Custom modules
we can create custom Python modules - Ansible provides a starter project to help us with this task
    - many options are available, such as:
    - mutually exclusive task options
    - _changed_ and _msg_ are mandatory to be implemented
    - option choices
    - support for dry-run (check mode)
    - there is limited support to write the module in any scripting language (as long as it's installed on the remote host)


#### Callback plugins
- will perform custom actions in response to events, such as starting a task or completing a task
- we can update the _ansible.cfg_ file with the new plugins
    - settings per plugin need to be set in order for them to perform the expected actions, such as JABBER_SERV, JABBER_USER, JABBER_PASS, ... for the jabber notifications

```
[defaults]
callback_whitelist = mail, slack, junit, jabber, hipchat, logstash, ...
```

#### Speeding up Ansible
- Using ControlPersist in SSH, to keep only one connection per host
- _Pipelining_ commands, skipping copying the code
    - _requiretty_ must be disabled on the host
- fact gathering can be disabled per playbook or made by default optional
    - locally JSON or a Redis/Memcached backend can be used for caching

``` roles/django/meta/main.yaml
dependencies:
    - { role: web }
    - { role: memcached }
```

#### Galaxy:
- ansible-galaxy is an open source repository of roles contributed by the community (stored on GitHub)

#### Vault:
* to create a vault and then edit to to insert information `ansible-vault create _filename_`
* to encrypt an existing file `ansible-vault encrypt _filename_`
* once you start using vault it's recommended that you always run either view or edit and never decrypt
    * encryption is reversible, so if decided, you can as well stop using vault
* we need to create a special folder structure in order for the vault to automatically find the vaulted passwords
```
--+ group_vars
  +--+ <environment>
     +--> vault     # all variables start w/ vault_
     +--> vars      # define variables as test_variable: "{{vault_test_variable}}"
```

#### Jinja2 templating:
* filters can be applied to many items; e.g. file paths - `dirname` or `realpath` => `{{user_file | realpath}}`
  * plenty default filters, such as: `failed`, `changed`, `skipped`
    * many others for files: `basename`, `dirname`, `realpath`
* we can also define our own filters
* we can _lookup_ a file to get its content across to our server ```ec2_key: name=mykey key_material="{{ lookup('file', \
  '/Users/lorin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"```

#### Vagrant
a quick intro into using Vagrant with Ansible

#### AWS:
- use the `ec2` module already available for Ansible
- use auth tokens and not user/pass
- dynamic inventory
- very important to tag all resources
    - we can use `wait_for` in order to take into account the creation time
- to make the creation idempotent we need to tag the instances and use `exact_count: X` and `count_tag: {type: NAME_OF_TAG}` then we won't get new instances if the VMs requested are created
- in order to create new Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) the recommended way is to use Packer form Hashicorp + Ansible Remote Provisioner
    - it will take a JSON template as input
- many, many more modules - `route53`, `s3`, `cloudformation`


#### debugging
- we can set strategy as debug, so on exceptions we will get into an interactive python debugger
- we can use the `assert` module as well to trigger early warnings about issues
- various other checks/lists `--list-tasks, --list-tags, --check, --syntax-check`
    - `--diff` can be used together with `--check` to see what will be changed
- we can as well step through the playbook with `--step` or start at a particular point `--start-at-task`


#### Docker:
* useful commands:
* `docker pull <image_name>`
* `docker image rm <hash>` - remove from disk given image/container
* `docker ps` - list running containers
* `docker images` - list available images locally
* `docker run -d -p 2222:22 <image>` - start image, mapping ssh port, -d = detach or daemon :)
