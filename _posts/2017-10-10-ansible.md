## Ansible:
#### Intro:
- ping/test all hosts in inventory file `ansible -m ping -i inventory.yaml all `
- you can define the default inventory file in your ~/.ansible.cfg or in the current folder ./ansible.cfg
```
[defaults]
hostfile = inventory.yaml
host_key_checking = False
```

- to run a command on a host defined in the inventory: `ansible -i inventory.yaml -m command -a uptime host_one `
    - the `-m command` part can be omitted as it's default
        - we can rewrite the command as `ansible -a uptime host_one`, as mentioned ansible.cfg defines the inventory file
        - the part after -m represents a _module_, so depending on the module being executed we can get different information returned
        	- `-m setup` can retrieve information about the host
        	- `-m ping` uses the _ping_ module to check if the host is reachable
    - add `-s` to sudo
- `yum: state=present name=git` in the playbook, will actually use the yum module
	- or _name={{our_package}}_ if in the **vars:** section we set _our_package: git_
	- `include: playbook.yaml our_package=nginx` because we can override the variable
	- vars can be used as custom input fields, such as one-off/custom passwords
- handlers - a special task that can be executed if it is registered as a change
	- they don't run in the given order, but in the order they are notified
- playbooks will stop when encountering the first error, unless `ignore_errors: true`
	- debug can be enabled in tasks with `debug: var=my_output`
- first `shell:pwd` then we define register as `register: pwd_output`, then we can use the variable as `{{pwd_output['output']}}`
	- we can filter the output/variable value by using either _failed_ or _success_ , e.g. `{{ variable_value\|failed }}`
* Sample playbook

```
- name: Configure nginx
  hosts: docker
  sudo: True                              # JSON formatting is different
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      apt: name=nginx                     # [OR]
      shell: yum install -y nginx         # [OR]
      yum: state=present name=nginx       # [OR]
      service: state=started name=nginx

    - name: copy index.html
      template: src=templates/index.html.j2 dest=/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
mode=0644
```
*  YAML folding syntax, like this:

```
- name: install nginx
  apt: >
      name=nginx
      update_cache=yes
```

* to get access to online docs `ansible-doc service`
* to use handlers, we need to `notify` an external task
    * handlers are ran only once, no matter how many times they are triggered, at the end of the playbook

```
tasks:
  - name: update nginx config
    file: [...]
    notify: nginx restart

handlers:
  - name: nginx restart
    service: name=nginx state=restarted
```

* we can create templates in the `templates` folder, for example the nginx file will be called `templates/nginx.conf.j2` as it will use Jinja2 templating

```
server {
    [...]
    server_name {{ server_name }};
```
* The Inventory file(s)
    * we can specify hostnames, alternate ssh ports, user, private key file
    * ansible creates a special group for `all`
    * we can specify groups of groups w/ `:children`
    * we can use wildcards when specifying hostnames, for a "cattle vs. pets approach"
    * we can use per host / group variables

```
[prod]
server-http.example
server-https1.example zone=blue
server-https[2-6].example zone=red

[test]
virtual85

[all:vars]
ntp_host=time.us.world

[prod:vars]
db_user=packet
db_port=1521
```

#### Variables

* for better flexibility, vars can be set in files
    * ansible looks for host variable files in a directory called `host_vars` and group variable files in a directory called `group_vars`
* for external managed inventory (e.g. EC2) we can get or create a dynamic inventory script
* variables can be set in 1 or more locations
    * directly in the playbook by using a `vars` section
    * by specifying a `vars_files: - test.yml` section inside the playbook
    * in files adjacent to the inventory file(s)
* all tasks / executions' steps have a `changed` variable which is set to true/false depending on what that particular step did or didn't do

#### Facts


#### Docker:

* useful commands:
* `docker pull <image_name>`
* `docker image rm <hash>` - remove from disk given image/container
* `docker ps` - list running containers
* `docker images` - list available images locally
* `docker run -d -p 2222:22 <image>` - start image, mapping ssh port, -d = detach or daemon :)
