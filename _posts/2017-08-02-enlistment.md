A somewhat classical approach to military fiction - even though in the first 1/5 of the book there is not much fiction involved - some future apocalyptic world where there is a war raging between 2 superpowers, and there are fugitive mentions of other worlds.

Our guy is pissed because, you know, like in most apocalyptic worlds there is nothing good happening "at home" so he decides to join the army to fix this.

Descriptions of the training site and the exercises performed remind me rather of Old Man's War, at least regarding the overall tone set by the book and how our guy integrates relatively easy and how he does his best to "be there".

First book of the series was good, let's see how the next one fares.
