What you should know and try to remember:
- a "basket" of products
- they tend to represent indexes, but almost any kind of financial products can be included
- all costs incurred are present in the ETFs, as they all have yearly management comission
- you should strive to get the ones with 0.1% or even less 
- you should try to trade them with minimum costs, there are companies (Vanguard, Schwab, TD Ameritrade) which will allow you to do just that

Capitalization usuals : large (over 5bn USD) mid (1-5bn USD) small (less than 1bn USD)

Large Growth and Large Value ETFs
- Vanguard Large Cap (VV) 9bps (0.09%) - recommended for smaller portfolios
- Schwab US Large Cap (SCHX) 4bps - tracking Dow Jones US Large Cap 750 Total Stock Market Index
- Vanguard Mega Cap 300 Growth ETF (MGK) 11bps - tracking MSCI US Large Cap Growth Index - should combine with small caps in portfolio
- Vanguard Value Index ETF (VTV) 9 bps - tracking MSCI US Prime Market Value Index 400
- Vanguard Mega Cap 300 Value Index ETF (MGV) 11bps - to be combined with small caps, or use one above
- to avoid: DIA / SPY / PWB

- for everything average, you (should not) consider Vanguard Total World Stock (VT) 17 bps - with a broad scope of index tracking stocks from US and across the world

Coming up in Chapter 11 (no financial advice books should have this chapter :)) unless it is a lessons learned)
