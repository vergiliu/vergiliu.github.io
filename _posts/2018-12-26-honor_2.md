_contains spoilers - or maybe not?_

Our beloved captain and her six-legged cat is back for more space adventures. To be frank, I don't remember the cat being six-legged, but why not? I feel there are a lot of points throughout the book that could have been expanded, instead of just giving us more and more details about the background of the story.

As with the first book we had a winning recipe this time around there is not much difference. Again, as with the white captain hat, a bit overly exaggerated righteousness, but if there is a single thing you should read it for - the battles, this time not only in space, are simply epic and lovely page-turners.

Again, here and there, some things could have been better, greater, cleaner - but a solid book with good action. The characters could have been better, our captain could have been more human - if I can call her that - too correct, too perfect, so if that's what you're after, this is not the perfect 'characters' book.
