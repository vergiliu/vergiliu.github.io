_contains spoilers - or maybe not?_

Our beloved captain and her six-legged cat is back for more space adventures.
As with the first book we had a winning recipe this time around there is not much difference. Again, as with the white captain hat, a bit overly exaggerated righteousness, but if there is a single thing you should read it for - the battles, this time not only in space, are simply epic and lovely page-turners.

Again, here and there, some things could have been better, greater, cleaner - but a solid book with simply great space battles.
