`Redshirts by John Scalzi`

Taking an untested path in scifi writing (because you know, everyone's a critic) Scalzi is going wild in this short novel about... space, and TV-series?!?
What I would say that I found surprising is that the faith of the characters seems to be dictated by some alien forces, which ironically in this case seem to be something straight out of Hollywood.
Lots of references to Star Trek and the first science based TV series aired and a lot of fun to read, even though it falls short of being a great fiction book.
I would nonetheless recommend it, for the easy and short read and overall funny writing style.
