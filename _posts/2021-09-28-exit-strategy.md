This series is probably one of the best, if not the best (IMO, obviously) from one of current sci-fi authors.

Our beloved murder bot is back at it, intrigue, suspense, murders, robots, space it's beautiful and so perfect it deserves some praise from me. I would recommend this book to all sci-fi/fiction/space/robots fans.
