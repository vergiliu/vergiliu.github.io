- might contain spoilers of the story

So apparently, far enough into the future the human kind manages to launch a huge multi-generation ship to the stars.
Its final destination, an Earth-like planet in the closest solar system, 10 light years away... The story is following (at least in the first third) the lives of the main engineer, or probably troubleshooter is a better name, of the ship as they try to repair various things from inside the ship biomes.
The biomes are an interesting concept, in the sense that the ship is sort of an ark which manages to hold various Earth ecosystems on a smaller scale.
