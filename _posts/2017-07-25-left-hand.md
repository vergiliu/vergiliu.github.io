A peaceful and highly developed species tries to make exchange agreements with a humanoid like species, adapted somewhat to live in freezing conditions on the planet... ta daaa... Winter - guess it will be cold there.
For this endeavor an envoy is sent - single guy - to make first contact and make agreements with the guest planet/society.

More story than sci-fi story, but a solid one. The book says more about being unable to see beyond one's appearances and being prejudiced, for one reason or another.
Part of a bigger saga (6 books), but being rather independent

And this is not only a story about politics, or humanity, but a story about human aspirations and traits as well.
