The book is trying to look at the companies which have been consistently (more than 15 years) beaten the market and performed significantly better than their peers in the same industry.

Get the right people on the bus, and get the wrong people off it - as you only want real team players if the team is "playing hard" and not people just "good enough". Most of the times they will leave by themselves or be "helped" by the others to take this decision.

Rating TBD/5
