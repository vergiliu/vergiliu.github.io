I find the book to be a bit of a mixed bag - sure it has a nice and accessible tone and is sprinkled with jokes, and the writing style is remarkably pleasant, making it easy to "chew". For some that might be enough to make it a great book, for me it's still just maths, with a rather abstract tone and search for the unknown which is difficult to resonate with. Seems to be more memories of high school maths and theorems, and less "look - awesome - it's maths!".

Maybe if I've read it before/during high school I might have found it more illuminating or entertaining, or maybe some of us are just not made to love maths...

> I love the fact that exponential growth directly translates into deliciousness in puff pastry. The multiple layers of pastry are not just dramatic and beautiful, but so thin that they melt away delicately in one's mouth. Puff pastry has a reputation of being difficult to make, but I think the genius of the method is that the use of exponentials actually makes it rather easy to create those incredibly thin layers of pastry.
