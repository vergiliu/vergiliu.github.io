The book covers the basics of nginx, just skimming over parts of the architecture/design decisions. Gives you a good intro on nginx but nothing much. It mentions the plus version (with support) and some basic situations you can have but it leaves a lot to be desired or to the reader's curiosity - as in you need to read more books about nginx or online documentation.

I didn't get why we (the readers) had to be told the place where the chapter was (first?) written or why in a "Pro" book on nginx we were told how to compile it... I guess some things we'll never know
