Second book in the (quadrilogy?) trilogy is way better, it just feels like a product the author has taken feedback on from its readers. Finally we get to know what the Kel is, how did they become what they are today, we hear stories from the society - even though it's about the Vidona - overall a much more pleasant reading and experience.

The plot twist about 75% in the book is very good and holds its own to conclude the second chapter.
