#### Ursula K. Le Guin - The Lathe of Heaven

Lots of raving reviews, for a classic of the genre. Overall a nice book, but nothing that blows (my) your hair back.
One of the things I enjoyed was that it was much shorter than I anticipated, for some reason.
And now an awesomely cool quote:

  > "What nuclear stockpiles remained after the Cislunar War had been taken off and exploded in a series of interesting experiments out in the Asteroid Belt.
  > This building could stand up to anything left on Earth, except perhaps Mount Hood. Or a bad dream."


Rating 3/5
