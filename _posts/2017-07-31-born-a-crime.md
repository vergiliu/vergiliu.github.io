We get to "see" how were Trevor's childhood years, in a South Africa deeply divided by apartheid and all things deriving from that. It is an entertaining book, with a beautiful writing style, where not only we get a better view inside the mind of Trevor but we get a glimpse of the South African society and the scars it (still) bears after and during the divide.
