Boneshaker by Christie Priest [aug2012-oct2012]

In an approximate version of the Seattle gold rush, a true steampunk story
involving a deadly gas, drugs, leather and a cloudy and misty atmosphere.
Did I mention zombies? Or airships powered by steam?
Overall a nice and short read with a good story and interesting characters.

Rating 4/5
