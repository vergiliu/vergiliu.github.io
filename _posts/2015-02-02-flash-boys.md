`Flash Boys by Michael Lewis`

As this was my first book from Michael Lewis I have to say I was a bit skeptical about the raving reviews that his books got and started reading this one quite having quite high expectations.
Truth be told, it was rather entertaining and really a very detailed story about the way some of the companies work and their overall goals and tricks of the trade...
I am looking forward to more books from him, and I feel that this one in particular is pretty much spot on with lots of the facts, no matter what some argue.

As usual, you can look up the book on [Amazon] or [Goodreads].
