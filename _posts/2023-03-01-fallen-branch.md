This is an intriguing story (the first of many hopefully) about a secretive group of people living amongst us for hundreds (thousands?) of years hiding in plain sight and protecting ancient mysteries. The book tries to pique our interest by mixing the fantastic to the real-world with no hand-holding as to what is real and what not.

An investigative reporter get involutarily tangled in the web of this secretive society and tries to unravel some of the inexplicable things. I really enjoyed the story, the writing style has its quirks but it flows naturally and there is a lot of room for expanding the groups, settings and the characters in (hopefully) future books.

Book ends in a cliffhanger, though it doesn't detract from the end or the overall story.
