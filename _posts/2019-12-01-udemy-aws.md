### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- pricing: 
  - on demand
  - reserved (1yr or 3yrs)
  - spot 
  - dedicated 
- spot terminated will not be charged if terminated by Amazon
- first launch AMI cannot be encrypted (root can be encrypted later )
- on EBS backed, default action is to terminate and delete the volume
- termination protection by default is OFF
- **bootstrap scripts**
  - during EC2 instance creation, a bootstrap script can be used to take various action on the instance
- **instance metadata**
  - `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` information about this instance
  - `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data` information from bootstrap
    - e.g. /local-ipv4 - local IP address
    - or /public-ipv4 

##### EC2 Placement Groups
- only certain types of instances can be launched
- you can't move an existing instance into a placement group
- clustered
  - within a single AZ, same region, low latency, high throughput
  - cant span multiple AZ
- spread
  - small number of critical instances, independent from each other
  - in same AZ or different AZ
  - for single instances
- partitioned
  - each segment on different partitions, on separate racks/blades
  - multiple instances
  - homogenous (same type) of instances are recommended

##### EFS - Elastic File System
- similar to EBS, easy and simple way to provision user storage
- automatic growing and shrinking
- we can enable lifecycle management, similar to S3
  - we can move less used to EFS IA (infrequent access)
  - by default, replicated to all AZs in a Region
- we need amazon-efs-utils (e.g. `yum install amazon-efs-utils`)
- it needs a Security Group for provisioning
  - needs NFS ports opened for it to work
  - supports NFSv4
- pay as you go, up to PetaBytes, supports thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- **Read after Write consistency**
- can be using encryption in transit or not 

##### EC2 Security Groups
- all changes to SGs take effect immediately
- SG are STATEFUL, all inbound rules are added automatically to outbound rules
- we cannot blacklist a particular port or IP address
- 1 or more SGs can be assigned to an instance
- all inbound traffic (everything) is BLOCKED by default
- all outbound traffic is ALLOWED
- we can have any number of EC2 instances withing a single SG
- we can have multiple SGs to a single EC2 instance
- we can specifically ALLOW rules, but not DENY rules
- NACL are stateless, port or IP address can be blocked in NACLs

##### EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- persistent block storage
- 5 different flavours: 
  1. general purpose SSD (16000 iops) - gp2
  2. provisioned IOPS (64000 iops) SSD io1
  3. throughput HDD (500 iops) st1
  4. Cold HDD (250 iops) sc1
  5. EBS Magnetic - standard
  - max size is 16TB
- ebs volume ALWAYS on same AZ as the ec2 instance
- copy AMI to a different region by using snapshots
- additional volumes will continue to persist on termination, root volume will be terminated
- snapshots exist on S3, and are INCREMENTAL
- AMIs can be created from both volumes and snapshots
- you can stop instances to create a consistent snapshot
- you can change volume types on the fly
- AMI based on Region / OS / Arch / Launch Permissions / Storage for root device: Instance Store (ephemeral) / EBS Backed Volumes
  - EBS - from an EBS snapshot
  - Instance Store - root device created from template stored in S3
    - can be added only before startup of the AMI
    - sometimes called ephermeral storage
    - if instance is stopped, all data is lost
- EBS backed instance will not lose data on stop
- by default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination - for EBS backed the default can be changed (termination protection)

##### Encrypted Root Device volumes and snapshots
- an ec2 instance can be started with an encrypted root volume (new)
- to encrypt a volume - take a snapshot of the volume, copy the volume and select ENCRYPT, next create an IMAGE out of the encrypted snapshot -> that can be launched as an encrypted AMI
  - this cannot be launched as an unencrypted volume
  - snapshots of this will be encrypted automatically
  - volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted

##### CloudWatch
- monitors performance
- we can create Dashboards, can be global as well as regional
- we can create Alarms
- we can configure Events to respond to state changes
- logs - to store, monitor and aggregate performance data
- CloudTrail monitors API calls - it's more about auditing than performance
- Standard monitoring is at 5 minute intervals by default (can be set to 1 minute, for Detailed Monitoring)
- monitor service to check resources from AWS
  - host level metrics, CPU, network, disk, status
  - as well as applications

##### AWS CLI
- you need to setup access in IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- `aws configure`
- `aws s3 ls` - list all buckets
- to provision ec2 or aws resources

##### Region > AZ
- 19 regions & 57 AZs
- AZ (availability zone) think of it as a DataCenter
- Region: a geographical area, made up of 2 or more AZ
- Edge location: endpoints for caching content, used by CloudFront (CDN), ~ 150 edge locations currently
- 4 levels of support, 3 paid, TAM only on Enterprise level support

### Identity Access Management (IAM)
- manage users and level of access to the console
- shared access, granular permissions, Identity Federation
- MFA, password rotation policy
- temporary access for users, if necessary
- PCI DSS compliance
- key terms: Users, Groups, Policies (made from polici documents, JSON), Roles
- custom sign in domain
- IAM settings are all global, does not apply to regions
- best practice is to not directly use root account/"god mode"
- roles - allow one  service to use another service e.g. EC2 instance can use S3
- new users have _NO_ permissions when created 
  - key and secret ID assigned for programmatic access
  - user/password for console access, different than keys mentioned above
  - only visible once, make sure not to loose them
- always setup MFA on your root account
- password policies and rotation can be configured
- policies can be AWS or customer-managed
- CloudWatch can manage/create billing alarms
- SAML can give you federated SSO to AWS

##### IAM Roles
- ec2 instance -> Attach/Replace IAM Role
- roles are more secure than just storing your access key + secret access key
- roles are easier to manage
- can be assigned after the instance is created and are GLOBAL (universal)

####  S3 - Simple Storage Service
- **read S3 FAQ before exam**
- object based storage, unlimited in size
- 0 bytes to 5TB, stored in buckets
- example URL https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<bucketname>
- buckets must be unique globally (universal name), http200 when upload ok
  - an S3 object has: **key** (name), **value** (file data), **versionId**, **metadata**, and **Subresources**
    - ACL , torrent
  - Consistency types for S3 objects
    - read after write consistency for PUTs
    - eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs
- MFA delete protection can be set up
- built for 4 9s availability, guaranteed 3 9s; 11 9s durability
- charges: Storage, Requests, Storage Mgmt, Data transfer, Transfer Acceleration (CloudFront edge locations), Cross region replication
- storage classes (tiers)
  - S3 standard - can sustain loss of 2 facilities
  - S3 Infrequent Access (IA)
    - min 128KB size charged
    - objects stored for at least 30 days
  - S3 One Zone IA (reduced redundancy storage)
  - S3 Intelligent Tiering
  - S3 Glacier - for data archiving
    - 3 retrieval speeds: expedited (1-5 mins), std (3-5hrs), bulk (5-12hrs)
    - 90 days minimum
    - extra 8kb + 32kb metadata
    - bytes restored are relevant
  - S3 Glacier Deep Archive - 12hrs retrieval time
    - 180 days
    - std 12hrs, bulk 48hrs
    - bytes restored are relevant
- Control to buckets can be set using bucket policies 
- by default all new buckets are _private_
- S3 buckets can be configured to store access logs from S3 buckets access
- ACL are at object level
- encryption levels: -
  - in transit (HTTPS), 
  - at rest (server side)
    - S3 managed keys SSE S3
    - AWS KMS (Key Mgmt Service) SSE KMS
    - server side with client keys SSE C
- Version Control
  - stores all versions, including writes
  - once you enable it, can only be suspended
  - integrates with Lifecycle rules
  - integrates with MFA Delete
- S3 lifecycle rules
  - can be used in conjuction with versioning, and applied to current and previous versions
  - automate transitions to different tiers of storage
  - transition and expiration to XX from YY after number of days
- Cross Region Replication
  - can be used only when versioning is enabled, on both source and replication buckets
  - the replicated S3 can be in a different tier
  - only changes after enabling CRR are visible in the replicated bucket
    - files in existing bucket are not replicated automatically, all subsequent updates are recorded
  - won't replicate delete markers nor deletes of _individual_ versions
- Transfer Acceleration
  - upload directly to Edge Location which in turn uploads to S3

#### CostExplorer
- forecasting, 3 months
- last 13 months
- recommendations / trends

#### CloudFront
  - it is a global service - CDN
  - Edge Location - location where content will be cached - not an AZ nor Region
  - Origin: ec2, elb, s3, route53 - origin of files distributed towards cdn
  - Distribution (name of CDN): collection of edge locations, name given to the CDN; it can have 2 types
    - Web - use for websites
    - RTMP for streaming / Adobe something
  - edge location can be written to (see transfer acceleration)
  - objects are cached for TTL (time to leave), can be invalidated - you will be charged
  - access can be restricted using sign URLs or cookies
  - in a Distribution we can add `Invalidations` in case we want to no longer cache certain content/files/file types

#### Snowball
- PB-scale data transfer 50 80TB
- Snowball edge 100TB
- Import and Export large amounts of data to S3

#### Storage Gateway
- connects an on-premise software appliance with AWS storage infra
- virtual (VMWare or Hyper-V) or physical device as a Storage Gateway
- 3 types :
  - File Gateway (NFS, SMB) -> flat files, S3
  - Volume Gateway (iSCSI) -> EBS snapshots to S3
    - Stored Volumes -> store your primary data locally (on site)
    - Cached Volumes -> minimize the need of your local storage, only actively used data is stored -> stores data to S3
  - Tape Gateway - Virtual Tape Library -> archive data to cloud, virtual tapes to S3; directly to Glacier or Deep 

### Databases
#### Amazon RDS - Relational Database Services
- SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MariaDB, MySQL, Aurora (all OLTP)
- Multi AZ  for Disaster Recovery (auto failover)
- Read Replicas for Performance (no auto failover) - up to 5 copies
- RDS runs on virtual machines, but you cannot ssh into those
- RDS is not serverless (with exception of Aurora Serverless)
- can't SSH / RDP into the systems; patching and upgrades handled by Amazon

##### Backups
- Automated backups (between 1 - 35 days)
  - point in time recovery, down to second
  - free storage space equal to your database
- Database Snapshots are manually / user intiated
- restored version is a new RDS instance, with a new DNS record
- encryption at rest is done using KMS, supported for all DB types: backups, snapshots and read replicas

- Multi-AZ - synchronous replication - same database in an extra AZ
  - automatic failover
  - for DR ONLY, not for PERFORMANCE
  - to switch AZ, we can `reboot with failover`
- Read-replicas are used for PERFORMANCE
  - SQL Server does NOT support currently read-replicas
  - we can have chained-read-replicas (read replicas of read replicas), watch out for LATENCY
  - read-only from primary RDS instance, async replication
  - read-heavy workloads are benefiting from read-replicas
  - up to 5 read replicas copies
  - automatic backups need to be enabled to use read-replicas
  - can be promoted to primary DB/master, no longer a read-replica
  - extra replica can be set up in a second region
  - read replica can be in any region

#### DynamoDB
- tailored for OLTP (OnLine Transactional Processing)
- NoSQL database service, single millisecond latency
- stored on SSD storage, 
- across 3 geographically distinct data centers
- eventual consistent reads (best read performance, no reads within 1 sec) vs strongly consistent reads (1 sec requirement)

##### Amazon RedShift 
- data warehousing, business intelligence, OLAP
- single node (160GB) or multi-node (leader node + compute nodes - 128 max)
- using column compression
- Massive Parallel Processing (MPP) - distributes data and query across nodes
- default backups of 1 day retention period, max 35 days, default ON
- at least 3 copies of your data: original, backup in S3, copies on compute node
- billing for compute nodes, not for the leader nodes
- encrypted in transit (SSL) and at rest
- only 1AZ availability
- can do async replication to S3 for DR, in another region

##### Amazon Aurora
- 10GB to 64TB, 10GB increments
- 2 copies of your data in each AZ, minimum of 3AZs (6 copies)
- can share Aurora snapshots with other AWS accounts
- can handle the loss of 2 copies without affecting database write availability
  - 3 copies loss without affecting read availability
- aurora and/or mysql replicas
  - automated failover only on aurora replicas
- up to 5x MySQL performance
- up to 15 replicas (vs 5 for MySQL)
- automated backups always enabled, do not impact performance, ON by default
- migration from mysql to aurora, then promoting it to primary instance
  - take snapshot from aurora, then restore snapshot

##### ElastiCache
- web service to deploy, operate and scale in-memory caches
- increase db and web application performance
- in memory caches
  - memcached
    - can scale horizontally + multi-threaded performance
  - Redis
    - data types, sorting data sets, pub/sub, persistence, multi-AZ, backup & restore

### Security, Identity & Compliance

### Network & Content Delivery

#### Route53
- DNS
- ELB do not have IPv4 addresses, you resolve them using a DNS name
- registrars - authority that can assign domain names
- SOA (start of authority) record - name of the server, administrator, TTL, current version
- NS (name server) - direct traffic to content server
- DNS records
  - `A record` (address) 
  - `CName` (canonical name) - used to resolve one domain name to another
  - `Alias record` - similar to CName, but can't be used for naked domain name (zone apex record) - always choose if selecting between Alias record or CName
  - TTL - length that a DNS record is cached, lower faster that changes take place
  - MX record - for emaul
- PTR record, reverse of A record
- understand difference between Alias Record and CName
- you can buy domain names directly from AWS
  - up to 3 days to register, depending on circumstances
- Routing policies:
  - **simple**
    - `Create Record Set`
    - 1 record with multiple IP addresses, in RANDOM order
  - **weighted**
    - 10% to us-east-1, 90% to us-west-1; weight into different areas
    - 1 record set per IP
    - we can configure Health Checks for the Route53 DNS redirects
      - on individual record sets; SNS notifications are possible
  - **latency-based policy**
    - based on lowest network latency for your end user
    - Route53 will choose the link with the lowest latency
  - **failover**
    - using an active/passive setup
    - on failure, active switches to the alternative route (passive)
    - we want to associate it with a health check (at least the primary site)
  - **geolocation routing policy**
    - lets you choose traffic redirect depending on the geographic location of your users
    - different than latency based routing
    - Location can be done by _country_ or _continent_
  - geoproximity (traffic flow only) - not in exam scope
    - based on geo location of your users and your resources
    - bias value can be adjusted, need to use Route53 Traffic Flow
      - Traffic policies must be created
  - **multivalue answer policy**
    - still need to create one entry per route
    - similar to simple routing, allows to check each resource, so it will return only healthy routes based on health checks

#### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- think of it as a logical data center in AWS:
  - Network Gateways
  - Routing tables
  - NACL - stateless
  - Security Groups - stateful
- NO TRANSITIVE PEERING
- assign custom IP address ranges
- Default VPC
  - default VPC is user friendly, you can immediately deploy instances
  - all subnets in default VPC have a route out to internet
  - each EC2 instance has a public and private IP address
  - 1 subnet is always = 1 AZ
    - there can be multiple subnets in the same AZ
- Custom VPC
  - no transitive peering
  - you can peer between Regions
- you can have by default 5 VPCs / region
- us-east-1a / 1b / 1c are randomized, so there is better traffic balancing
- Bastion box / jump box - securely administer ec2 instances
- NAT Gateway or NAT Instance is used to provide internet traffic to ec2 instances
  - a NAT gateway cannot be used as a Bastion host
- **Direct Connect**
  - cloud service that helps you connect between office/DC/collo and AWS
  - useful for high throughput workloads or need a reliable secure connection
- VPC Endpoint
  - Interface Endpoints
  - Gateway Endpoints: supports S3 and DynamoDB only
- privately connect your VPC to your AWS services
- traffic between VPC and the other Amazon service does not leave the AWS network
- horizontally scalable
- attach ENI (Elastic Network Interface) to EC2 instance, and then we can talk directly to - AWS services
- Internet gateway - allows our VPC to talk to the internet
##### VPC
  - creation: name; IPv4 CIDR block; IPv6 CIDR is supported and optional
  - by default it does not create any subnets or _internet gateway_
    - subnets need to be created if we want to use our newly created VPC
      - ** 1 subnet in 1 AZ, ALWAYS **
      - AZ names are randomized
      - 5 IP addresses are reserved, only from /16 to /28
      - we need to select Auto assign IP address, in order to be able to create ec2 instances
    - Sec Groups cannot span VPCs
    - igw (internet gateway) can be created, it needs to be attached to VPC 1-to-1
      - HA for igw enabled through the design
    - a subnet needs to be associated to route table
  - it creates a Security Group, NACL, and Route Table
- NAT Instances vs NAT Gateway
  - NAT instance - phasing out - single ec2 instance
    - send/receive traffic when a source / dest is not itself; acting as a gateway
    - we need to disable source and destination check
    - must be in a public subnet, behind a SecGroup
    - single instance, single point of failure, must be in a public subnet, and a route out from public subnet
    - HA can be implemented, but more complex setup
    - always behind a Security Group
  - NAT Gateway
    - elastic IP, redundant inside AZ
    - 1 NAT GW inside 1 AZ, start at 5gbps up to 45gbps
    - no SG associations, no need to patch, auto assigned IP address
    - route needs to be added for both instance types
    - for resources in multiple AZ sharing a single AZ, resources in other AZ lose internet access in case NAT GW / AZ is down; we need to configure routing with multi-AZ to address this 
    - it needs a route out to the Internet
 - Network ACLs
  - always evaluated before the Security Groups
  - there is a default NetworkACL in your VPC; a subnet can only be associated with 1 NACL
    - default allows all in and out
    - NACL can have multiple subnets inside
  - on creation, default setting is DENY ALL in and out traffic
  - read all links from the _Resources_
  - they are evaluated in shown order, DENY should be before ALLOW
    - each rule can ALLOW or DENY traffic
  - each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a NACL
    - if not explicitly associated, subnet is assoc with default ACL which allows everything
  - blocking IP addresses is done using NACLs not Security Groups
  - 1 subnet associated with 1 NACL; previous are removed
  - lowest number rule is evaluated first
  - ARE STATELESS; both inbound and outbound rules need to be defined
- VPC Flow Logs
  - capturing traffic: can log All, or Accepted traffic, or Rejected traffic
    - can be stored to CloudWatch logs or to S3 bucket
  - you cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC, unless same account
  - you cannot tag a flow log
  - after creating a flow log, you cannot change  (can't associate different IAM)
  - DNS traffic won't be monitored
  - traffic to 169.254.169.254 won't be monitored; 
    - traffic for windows license activation wont be monitored
    - traffic to reserved IP addresses wont be monitored
    - DHCP traffic not monitored
  - at VPC level, at subnet level, at network level
  - storing network traffic

#### ELB (Elastic Load Balancers)
- **many questions for the exam** - never IP address, only using DNS name
- 3 types:
  - ALB (Application Load Balancer) intelligent, HTTP/HTTPS - Layer 7
    - route to Target Group
    - more intelligent than Classic LB
  - NLB (Network Load Balancer) TCP - Layer 4 - performance is paramount
    - highest performance
  - Classic Load Balancer: L7 or L4, currently being deprecated
    - simple routing, cheapest
    - ping protocol, port, path, intervals, timeout, threshold
- ALB - can be internal or external
- NLB - millions requests / second
- instances monitored by ELB can be InService or OutofService
- LB have their own DNS name, _you never get an IP address_
- when provisioning a LB, we need at least 2 PUBLIC SUBNETS
- Target Group - 
- 504 (gateway timeout) application has timed out, need to troubleshoot application as app / database layers are not responding
- to get IPv4 of users look for X-Forwarded-For header
- state of instance is *InService or OutofService*
- **10 questions in exam, read ELB FAQ for Exam**
##### Advanced Load Balancer
- Sticky Sessions for ALB and Classic LB, for ALB requests per Target Group
  - all traffic sent to single node out of many
- Cross Zone Load Balancing - us-east-1a 4 hosts / us-east-1b 1 host -> 20% / host
   - balance traffic across multiple AZ
- **Path Patterns** - traffic can be sent to a different AZ, depending on URL path of request (e.g. /images/ )
##### Auto-Scaling Groups
##### High Availability architecture
- always design for failure
- use multiple AZ and multiple Regions
  - multi-AZ for DR for RDS, read-replicas for performance for RDS
- _read the questions carefully_!
- know the difference between different S3 storage classes
- HA app
  - s3 - create distribution - 2 buckets
  - rds w/ multi-az
  - ec2 instance running wordpress
- CloudFront data can take up to 10 minutes to have all propagated
- RDS: failover from 1 AZ to another, option in RDS -> reboot with failover
- ALB need to be deleted before our Target Groups
- _CloudFormation_ <- Management and Governance
  - select/create a template; a template can be read from S3
  - AWS Quick Starts are available for lots of advanced CloudFormation apps/tools prepared by solution architects
  - Delete stack
  - completely scripting your cloud environment
- Elastic Beanstalk
  - create an environment + uplod your code => ready!
    - create app / Security Groups / S3 buckets / ....
    - grow your infrastructure, input is only code (type), e.g. PHP for WordPress
  - you can use autoscaling with Elastic Beanstalk
  - quickly deploy and manage apps in AWS
### Applications
##### SQS (Simple Queue Service)
- *pull based*, NOT push based
- 2 types:
  - Standard queues - practically unlimited number of transactions per second
    - more than 1 copy might be delivered
    - can be out of order
  - FIFO - up to 300 msg/s
    - always in order
    - exactly once delivered
    - support message groups
- 256KB in size
- guarantees that messages are processed at least once
- visibility timeout - how long they're invisible after a reader picks up a message; max 12hrs
- long polling doesn't return a response until a message arrives, or a long timeout occurs
- retention period of 14 days
- message oriented API
##### SFW (Simple WorkFlow Service)
- way of coordinating apps as well as manual processes
- task assigned only once, never duplicated
- when there's a human element, the SWF is preferred over SQS
- task oriented API
- workflow starters, deciders or activity workers - it's SWF
##### SNS (Simple Notification Service)
- push notifications, instantaneous; *push based*
  - can deliver notifications by email, to SQS, or to any HTTP endpoint
  - you can group multiple recipients using topics
- all messages are stored redundantly across multiple AZ
- set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud
- publish messages from an app
- flexible message delivery over multiple transport protocols
##### Elastic Transcoder
- media transcoder in the cloud
- transcoding presets for popular output formats
- pay based on minutes of transcoded media and resolution
- S3 bucket -> Lambda function -> Elastic Transcoder -> S3 bucket
##### API Gateway (a lot in exam)
- managed service, easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs
- API that acts as a "front door" for apps running in EC2, Lambda, ...
- expose https endpoints to define a RESTful API
- track & control usage / throttle / CloudWatch
- caching can be enabled to increase performance to cache your endpoint response; a TTL is defined in SECONDS
- CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) restricted resources can be requested from another domain (e.g. fonts from Google)
  - HTTP OPTIONS for url -> these domains are approved for GET or ERROR CORS needs enabling
  - CORS is enforced by client (browser)
- scales automatically and is low cost
- you can throttle API GW to prevent attacks
##### Kinesis
Streaming Data is generated continuously by many sources, and usually small sizes (social network data, purchases, geo data, game data, stock prices, IoT data)
Kinesis is a platform to send your streaming data
1. Kinesis Streams 
  - data has persistence
  - 24 hours storage by default (max 7 days)
  - data is stored in _shards_; 5 tps per reads; 1000 records per second writes
  - data can be analyzed by "Consumers" using EC2 instances; which in turn can save it to DynamoDB / S3 / EMR / RedShift
2. Kinesis Firehose
  - there is no persistent storage
  - data comes in, triggers lambda function -> outputs it somewhere
3. Kinesis Analytics
  - works for Streams and Firehose and analyzes data
##### Web Identity Federation - Cognito
- give users access to AWS resources after auth on Facebook/Google/Amazon
- Cognito is a web identity federation service
  - access for guest users
  - acts as Identity Broker between your app and web id providers, no need to write your own code
  - recommended for mobile apps for AWS
  - brokers between app and AWS
- User Pools - sign up / sign in for mobile and web
  - JSON Web Token (JWT) - converted from a Token coming in from Google/Facebook
  - email address (example)
  - user auth / registration 
- Identity Pools 
  - granting the actual access to an AWS resource
  - authorizes access to AWS resources
- tracks association from user identity and various devices
