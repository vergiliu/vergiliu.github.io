### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- pricing: 
  - on demand
  - reserved (1yr or 3yrs)
  - spot 
  - dedicated 
- spot terminated will not be charged if terminated by Amazon
- first launch AMI cannot be encrypted (root can be encrypted later )
- on EBS backed, default action is to terminate and delete the volume
- termination protection by default is OFF
- **bootstrap scripts**
  - during EC2 instance creation, a bootstrap script can be used to take various action on the instance
- **instance metadata**
  - `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` information about this instance
  - `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data` information from bootstrap
    - e.g. /local-ipv4 - local IP address
    - or /public-ipv4 

##### EC2 Placement Groups
- only certain types of instances can be launched
- you can't move an existing instance into a placement group
- clustered
  - within a single AZ, same region, low latency, high throughput
  - cant span multiple AZ
- spread
  - small number of critical instances, independent from each other
  - in same AZ or different AZ
  - for single instances
- partitioned
  - each segment on different partitions, on separate racks/blades
  - multiple instances
  - homogenous (same type) of instances are recommended

##### EFS - Elastic File System
- similar to EBS, easy and simple way to provision user storage
- automatic growing and shrinking
- we can enable lifecycle management, similar to S3
  - we can move less used to EFS IA (infrequent access)
  - by default, replicated to all AZs in a Region
- we need amazon-efs-utils (e.g. `yum install amazon-efs-utils`)
- it needs a Security Group for provisioning
  - needs NFS ports opened for it to work
  - supports NFSv4
- pay as you go, up to PetaBytes, supports thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- **Read after Write consistency**
- can be using encryption in transit or not 

##### EC2 Security Groups
- all changes to SGs take effect immediately
- SG are STATEFUL, all inbound rules are added automatically to outbound rules
- we cannot blacklist a particular port or IP address
- 1 or more SGs can be assigned to an instance
- all inbound traffic (everything) is BLOCKED by default
- all outbound traffic is ALLOWED
- we can have any number of EC2 instances withing a single SG
- we can have multiple SGs to a single EC2 instance
- we can specifically ALLOW rules, but not DENY rules
- NACL are stateless, port or IP address can be blocked in NACLs

##### EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- persistent block storage
- 5 different flavours: 
  1. general purpose SSD (16000 iops) - gp2
  2. provisioned IOPS (64000 iops) SSD io1
  3. throughput HDD (500 iops) st1
  4. Cold HDD (250 iops) sc1
  5. EBS Magnetic - standard
  - max size is 16TB
- ebs volume ALWAYS on same AZ as the ec2 instance
- copy AMI to a different region by using snapshots
- additional volumes will continue to persist on termination, root volume will be terminated
- snapshots exist on S3, and are INCREMENTAL
- AMIs can be created from both volumes and snapshots
- you can stop instances to create a consistent snapshot
- you can change volume types on the fly
- AMI based on Region / OS / Arch / Launch Permissions / Storage for root device: Instance Store (ephemeral) / EBS Backed Volumes
  - EBS - from an EBS snapshot
  - Instance Store - root device created from template stored in S3
    - can be added only before startup of the AMI
    - sometimes called ephermeral storage
    - if instance is stopped, all data is lost
- EBS backed instance will not lose data on stop
- by default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination - for EBS backed the default can be changed (termination protection)

##### Encrypted Root Device volumes and snapshots
- an ec2 instance can be started with an encrypted root volume (new)
- to encrypt a volume - take a snapshot of the volume, copy the volume and select ENCRYPT, next create an IMAGE out of the encrypted snapshot -> that can be launched as an encrypted AMI
  - this cannot be launched as an unencrypted volume
  - snapshots of this will be encrypted automatically
  - volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted

##### CloudWatch
- monitors performance
- we can create Dashboards, can be global as well as regional
- we can create Alarms
- we can configure Events to respond to state changes
- logs - to store, monitor and aggregate performance data
- CloudTrail monitors API calls - it's more about auditing than performance
- Standard monitoring is at 5 minute intervals by default (can be set to 1 minute, for Detailed Monitoring)
- monitor service to check resources from AWS
  - host level metrics, CPU, network, disk, status
  - as well as applications

##### AWS CLI
- you need to setup access in IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- `aws configure`
- `aws s3 ls` - list all buckets
- to provision ec2 or aws resources

##### Region > AZ
- 19 regions & 57 AZs
- AZ (availability zone) think of it as a DataCenter
- Region: a geographical area, made up of 2 or more AZ
- Edge location: endpoints for caching content, used by CloudFront (CDN), ~ 150 edge locations currently
- 4 levels of support, 3 paid, TAM only on Enterprise level support

### Identity Access Management (IAM)
- manage users and level of access to the console
- shared access, granular permissions, Identity Federation
- MFA, password rotation policy
- temporary access for users, if necessary
- PCI DSS compliance
- key terms: Users, Groups, Policies (made from polici documents, JSON), Roles
- custom sign in domain
- IAM settings are all global, does not apply to regions
- best practice is to not directly use root account/"god mode"
- roles - allow one  service to use another service e.g. EC2 instance can use S3
- new users have _NO_ permissions when created 
  - key and secret ID assigned for programmatic access
  - user/password for console access, different than keys mentioned above
  - only visible once, make sure not to loose them
- always setup MFA on your root account
- password policies and rotation can be configured
- policies can be AWS or customer-managed
- CloudWatch can manage/create billing alarms
- SAML can give you federated SSO to AWS

##### IAM Roles
- ec2 instance -> Attach/Replace IAM Role
- roles are more secure than just storing your access key + secret access key
- roles are easier to manage
- can be assigned after the instance is created and are GLOBAL (universal)

####  S3 - Simple Storage Service
- **read S3 FAQ before exam**
- object based storage, unlimited in size
- 0 bytes to 5TB, stored in buckets
- example URL https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<bucketname>
- buckets must be unique globally (universal name), http200 when upload ok
  - an S3 object has: **key** (name), **value** (file data), **versionId**, **metadata**, and **Subresources**
    - ACL , torrent
  - Consistency types for S3 objects
    - read after write consistency for PUTs
    - eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs
- MFA delete protection can be set up
- built for 4 9s availability, guaranteed 3 9s; 11 9s durability
- charges: Storage, Requests, Storage Mgmt, Data transfer, Transfer Acceleration (CloudFront edge locations), Cross region replication
- storage classes (tiers)
  - S3 standard - can sustain loss of 2 facilities
  - S3 Infrequent Access (IA)
    - min 128KB size charged
    - objects stored for at least 30 days
  - S3 One Zone IA (reduced redundancy storage)
  - S3 Intelligent Tiering
  - S3 Glacier - for data archiving
    - 3 retrieval speeds: expedited (1-5 mins), std (3-5hrs), bulk (5-12hrs)
    - 90 days minimum
    - extra 8kb + 32kb metadata
    - bytes restored are relevant
  - S3 Glacier Deep Archive - 12hrs retrieval time
    - 180 days
    - std 12hrs, bulk 48hrs
    - bytes restored are relevant
- Control to buckets can be set using bucket policies 
- by default all new buckets are _private_
- S3 buckets can be configured to store access logs from S3 buckets access
- ACL are at object level
- encryption levels: -
  - in transit (HTTPS), 
  - at rest (server side)
    - S3 managed keys SSE S3
    - AWS KMS (Key Mgmt Service) SSE KMS
    - server side with client keys SSE C
- Version Control
  - stores all versions, including writes
  - once you enable it, can only be suspended
  - integrates with Lifecycle rules
  - integrates with MFA Delete
- S3 lifecycle rules
  - can be used in conjuction with versioning, and applied to current and previous versions
  - automate transitions to different tiers of storage
  - transition and expiration to XX from YY after number of days
- Cross Region Replication
  - can be used only when versioning is enabled, on both source and replication buckets
  - the replicated S3 can be in a different tier
  - only changes after enabling CRR are visible in the replicated bucket
    - files in existing bucket are not replicated automatically, all subsequent updates are recorded
  - won't replicate delete markers nor deletes of _individual_ versions
- Transfer Acceleration
  - upload directly to Edge Location which in turn uploads to S3

#### CostExplorer
- forecasting, 3 months
- last 13 months
- recommendations / trends

#### CloudFront
  - it is a global service - CDN
  - Edge Location - location where content will be cached - not an AZ nor Region
  - Origin: ec2, elb, s3, route53 - origin of files distributed towards cdn
  - Distribution (name of CDN): collection of edge locations, name given to the CDN; it can have 2 types
    - Web - use for websites
    - RTMP for streaming / Adobe something
  - edge location can be written to (see transfer acceleration)
  - objects are cached for TTL (time to leave), can be invalidated - you will be charged
  - access can be restricted using sign URLs or cookies
  - in a Distribution we can add `Invalidations` in case we want to no longer cache certain content/files/file types

#### Snowball
- PB-scale data transfer 50 80TB
- Snowball edge 100TB
- Import and Export large amounts of data to S3

#### Storage Gateway
- connects an on-premise software appliance with AWS storage infra
- virtual (VMWare or Hyper-V) or physical device as a Storage Gateway
- 3 types :
  - File Gateway (NFS, SMB) -> flat files, S3
  - Volume Gateway (iSCSI) -> EBS snapshots to S3
    - Stored Volumes -> store your primary data locally (on site)
    - Cached Volumes -> minimize the need of your local storage, only actively used data is stored -> stores data to S3
  - Tape Gateway - Virtual Tape Library -> archive data to cloud, virtual tapes to S3; directly to Glacier or Deep 

### Databases
#### Amazon RDS - Relational Database Services
- SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MariaDB, MySQL, Aurora
- Multi AZ  for Disaster Recovery (auto failover)
- Read Replicas for Performance (no auto failover) - up to 5 copies
- RDS runs on virtual machines, but you cannot ssh into those
- RDS is not serverless (with exception of Aurora Serverless)

##### Backups
- Automated backups (between 1 - 35 days)
  - point in time recovery, down to second
  - free storage space equal to your database
- Database Snapshots are manually / user intiated
- restored version is a new RDS instance, with a new DNS record
- encryption at rest is done using KMS, supported for all DB types: backups, snapshots and read replicas

- Multi-AZ - synchronous replication - same database in an extra AZ
  - automatic failover
  - for DR only, not for PERFORMANCE
  - to switch AZ, we can `reboot with failover`
- Read-replicas are used for PERFORMANCE
  - SQL Server does not support currently read-replicas
  - we can have chained-read-replicas (read replicas of read replicas), watch out for LATENCY
  - read-only from primary RDS instance, async replication
  - read-heavy workloads are benefiting from read-replicas
  - up to 5 read replicas copies
  - automatic backups need to be enabled to use read-replicas
  - can be promoted to primary DB/master, no longer a read-replica
  - extra replica can be set up in a second region
  - read replica can be in any region

#### DynamoDB
- tailored for OLTP (OnLine Transactional Processing)
- NoSQL database service, single millisecond latency
- stored on SSD storage, 
- across 3 geographically distinct data centers
- eventual consistent reads (best read performance, no reads within 1 sec) vs strongly consistent reads (1 sec requirement)

##### Amazon RedShift 
- data warehousing, business intelligence, OLAP
- single node (160GB) or multi-node (leader node + compute nodes - 128 max)
- using column compression
- Massive Parallel Processing (MPP) - distributes data and query across nodes
- default backups of 1 day retention period, max 35 days
- at least 3 copies of your data: original, backup in S3, copies on compute node
- billing for compute nodes, not for the leader nodes
- encrypted in transit (SSL) and at rest
- only 1AZ availability
- can do async replication to S3 for DR

##### ElastiCache
- in memory caches
  - memcached
  - Redis
### Security, Identity & Compliance
### Network & Content Delivery
