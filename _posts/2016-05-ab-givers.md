In this book the author is trying to convene to us information about psychology and the types of people matching those profiles that he will describe.
First of all there are three types of people that he divides all people into: the givers, the takers, and the matchers.
Even if on first sight we would say that the takers are the most successful of the tree, on closer inspection we can see that actually neither the the takers nor the matchers are. The most successful of the group remain the givers.
He then goes on describing many situations, either staged during trials or actual day-to-day situations, in order to re-enforce that idea.
