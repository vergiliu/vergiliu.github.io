The story is very well written and easy to follow and read, it's nice for a (couple, one? of) beach afternoon and it could have so many directions where the story and implications could have gone that it's really disappointing not to see it materialize any of them.

Its main focus is a handful of characters, in an alternate utopia England,  that are born and raised just as organ donors. They live all their young lives in a farm like setting without ever venturing beyond the fence, they never do anything, nothing happens throughout the story, everything is boring to pain... yet everybody is merrily walking along in a maximum boredom....

3 stars, and 1 of them is really dented due to the boredom
