In a classic book from Vonnegut - this is my first book from him, and I must admit I was pretty curious - the author re-lives in a fantastical way the bombing of Dresden as seen first hand from a POW. 

As usual, you can find the book on [Amazon] or [Goodreads], if you're looking for more information or a place to grab a copy.
