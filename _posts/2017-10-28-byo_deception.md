The first 3rd of the book is good, well thought out and put together, with a solid story line presenting the moment of finding out and bombing a secret place where uranium was enriched and getting us started in the recruiting and so-called trial period for the secret agents of Mossad.
I was not very fond throughout the book with the use of Hebrew words, ok I get `katsa` is like a secret agent but I don't need to know what everything is called in Hebrew, I want just to enjoy the story.
