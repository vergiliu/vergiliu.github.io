_contains spoilers - or maybe not?_

Our beloved captain and her six-legged cat is back for more space adventures.

Space battles and regular battles are as amazing as ever, unfortunately the story is very similar in many ways to the previous one, and I am not sure what in the other 5-10 books is added.
