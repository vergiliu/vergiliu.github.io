The first book in the trilogy - which btw I've gotten cheap for Kindle in a sale - is a really interesting story with quite amazing characters and setting. THough I will start with the one thing I loathe about it - what the hell does everything mean or does? What is the Kel? How does this calendrical whatever works? How is society functioning and everything working in this space faring civilizations so advanced that have guns based on ... calendars?
On the one hand many chapters were really good and entertaining, on the other - everytime a new made up (I'm not upset that it was made up) thing appeared it made me cringe as there was no single sentence describing what it is to the story, how it integrates into everything. I mean ok, some items made a bit of sense, but for others really... 

I am really curious about the 2nd (3rd?) book in the series - if it's similar in its sparseness of adding that one line so we can follow the damn story, I cannot see myself reading any further.
