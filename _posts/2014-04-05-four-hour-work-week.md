I was really eager to get my hands on the `4 Hour Work Week by T. Ferriss` book, and some friends thought it would be a nice gift - thanks guys.

Now, with somewhat mixed feelings I was going through the book, and about half-way through I must admit it's not all the way roses.

To be continued...

Rating 3/5
