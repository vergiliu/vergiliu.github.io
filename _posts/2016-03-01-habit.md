The book goes on analyzing what happens in our brains/minds and when habits form and how we can manage them or get rid of bad ones
In first part we look at how our habits are formed after repeating one or more actions for some time and then the brain takes over and stores those actions as a habit in the core of the brain -  basal ganglia
