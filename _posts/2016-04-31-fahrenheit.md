An utopic future, where firefighters don't try to put out fires, but instead... burn books.

And now, some quotes that caught my eye:

 >"There must be something in the books, things we can't imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don't stay for nothing."
 >"The sun burned every day. It burned Time."
