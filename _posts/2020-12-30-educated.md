This is a beautiful book and story, powerful and gut-wrenching at times that absolutely every one of us should read - I've "read" the audible version of it. 

It's about the struggles, set-backs, and victories of _life_ itself.

_PS_: I thought I had more notes from it, if so I will update it .... soon ?
