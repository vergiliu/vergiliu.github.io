## Ansible:
#### Intro:
- ping/test all hosts in inventory file `ansible -m ping -i inventory.yaml all `
- you can define the default inventory file in your ~/.ansible.cfg or in the current folder ./ansible.cfg
<pre>[defaults]
hostfile = inventory.yaml
host_key_checking = False
- to run a command on a host defined in the inventory: `ansible -i inventory.yaml -m command -a uptime host_one `
    - the `-m command` part can be omitted as it's default
        - we can rewrite the command as `ansible -a uptime host_one`, as mentioned ansible.cfg defines the inventory file
    - add `-s` to sudo

#### First playbook:
<pre>- name: Configure nginx
  hosts: docker
  sudo: True
  tasks: - name: install nginx
    apt: name=nginx

#### Docker:
- useful commands:
`docker pull <image_name>`
`docker image rm <hash>` - remove from disk given image/container
`docker ps` - list running containers
`docker images` - list available images locally
`docker run -d -p 2222:22 <image>` - start image, mapping ssh port, -d = detach or daemon :)
