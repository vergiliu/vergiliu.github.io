## Ansible:
#### Intro:
- ping/test all hosts in inventory file `ansible -m ping -i inventory.yaml all `
- you can define the default inventory file in your ~/.ansible.cfg or in the current folder ./ansible.cfg
```
[defaults]
hostfile = inventory.yaml
host_key_checking = False
```

- to run a command on a host defined in the inventory: `ansible -i inventory.yaml -m command -a uptime host_one `
    - the `-m command` part can be omitted as it's default
        - we can rewrite the command as `ansible -a uptime host_one`, as mentioned ansible.cfg defines the inventory file
        - the part after -m represents a _module_, so depending on the module being executed we can get different information returned
        	- `-m setup` can retrieve information about the host
        	- `-m ping` uses the _ping_ module to check if the host is reachable
    - add `-s` to sudo
- `yum: state=present name=git` in the playbook, will actually use the yum module
	- or _name={{our_package}}_ if in the **vars:** section we set _our_package: git_
	- `include: playbook.yaml our_package=nginx` because we can override the variable
	- vars can be used as custom input fields, such as one-off/custom passwords
- handlers - a special task that can be executed if it is registered as a change
	- they don't run in the given order, but in the order they are notified
- playbooks will stop when encountering the first error, unless `ignore_errors: true`
	- debug can be enabled in tasks with `debug: var=my_output`
- first `shell:pwd` then we define register as `register: pwd_output`, then we can use the variable as `{{pwd_output['output']}}`
	- we can filter the output/variable value by using either _failed_ or _success_ , e.g. `{{ variable_value\|failed }}`
* Sample playbook

```
- name: Configure nginx
  hosts: docker
  sudo: True                              # JSON formatting is different
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      apt: name=nginx                     # [OR]
      shell: yum install -y nginx         # [OR]
      yum: state=present name=nginx       # [OR]
      service: state=started name=nginx

    - name: copy index.html
      template: src=templates/index.html.j2 dest=/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
mode=0644
```
*  YAML folding syntax, like this:

```
- name: install nginx
  apt: >
      name=nginx
      update_cache=yes
```

* to get access to online docs `ansible-doc service`

#### Docker:

* useful commands:
* `docker pull <image_name>`
* `docker image rm <hash>` - remove from disk given image/container
* `docker ps` - list running containers
* `docker images` - list available images locally
* `docker run -d -p 2222:22 <image>` - start image, mapping ssh port, -d = detach or daemon :)
