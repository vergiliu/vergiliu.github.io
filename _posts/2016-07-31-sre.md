The book starts with lots of useful information and practices, I'll put down the ones that I considered important:

- don't try to have 100% availability as none of the supporting systems (network, power grid, storage, so on) has it, so going from 99.999% to 100% availability adds to much burden to costs and people

- the SRE are part developers part sysadmins, and their main goal is to automate all possible tasks related to the systems/networking/provisioning environment(s)
    - half of their time can be Ops related tasks, if more than that is needed, tasks are pushed back to development teams to take over
    - no more than 1-2 incidents per day/shift, and all should have post-mortem analysis in order to improve
- all SRE activities should be related to risk, and if we assign a risk capital that we can spend we can mitigate between having more releases with possibly
 more incidents and downtime, spending risk capital or doing less features and releases, thus having increased stability and spending less risk capital
- up to 50% should be coding-related or creating automated tools/improvements as the SRE spends less time than that, we should consider pushing back tasks to the team themselves
- availability should be considered in the context of other infrastructure of the client or application, in order to have trade-off between leeway for extra capacity or not
    - collaboration inside the team is esential for achiving some of the ideas
    - our monitoring tools should give us the end of quarter (or month for that matter) metrics and make it easy to see our current "risk spending"

- SLO service level objectives/ I - indicator (e.g. latency) / A - agreement not all 3 are similar, and sre focus on SLO and SLI
    - 4 broad categories of systems: user facing systems (availability, latency, throughput), storage (latency, availability, durability), big data (throughput, end2end latency), corectenss of data (not sre relevant, but app relevant)
    - average over 10 minutes, measure every 10 seconds so we don't get a skewed image of our system performance/issues for bursty requests
