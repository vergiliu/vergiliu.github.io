The book starts with lots of useful information and practices, I'll put down the ones that I considered important:

- don't try to have 100% availability as none of the supporting systems (network, power grid, storage, so on) has it, so going from 99.999% to 100% availability adds to much burden to costs and people
- the SRE are part developers part sysadmins, and their main goal is to automate all possible tasks related to the systems/networking/provisioning environment(s)
    - half of their time can be Ops related tasks, if more than that is needed, tasks are pushed back to development teams to take over
    - no more than 1-2 incidents per day/shift, and all should have post-mortem analysis in order to improve
