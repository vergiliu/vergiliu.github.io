Besides the fact that I've mis-remembered the title and got the wrong book to read, 3rd volume instead of 2nd volume, I cannot say too many other things as compared to the first book from the trilogy. Some of the good parts are, of course, the same - except at this heft I was just left wanting for more story and less descriptions. After the first quarter I just had to abandon it, moving on to more exciting books.
