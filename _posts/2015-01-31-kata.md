`Toyota Kata by Mike Rother`

I had a "slow start" when reading this book, but this far I find it pretty interesting from the point of view of looking at the issues and how to solve them - the book, as the name implies, is focussed on the Toyota manufacturing process, but its ideas and best-practices can be applied to mostly everything.

I'll present below some ideas from the book, or things that looked eye-opening:
* principles are developed from repeated actions
* there are 2 types of kata: improvement and coaching
* the goal of creating (item) lists is to learn from past issues and not make an action plan to fix them now
    * try changing a thing at a time and see if the outcome is the desired one or not, see cause and effect not a continuous back-and-forth of juggling issues
* Toyota way of thinking equates as daily mangement = process improvement

Rating /5
