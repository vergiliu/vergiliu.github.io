### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

#### EC2
- all instances have a private + public IP (NAT-ed)
- Load Balancers
    - use the security group assigned when the instance was created
    - thresholds can be easily set/configured, as well as the "ping-path"
    - tags are supported
    - all metrics are automatically reported to cloudwatch
- Elastic IPs
    - can be assigned to running instances: they will be static IPs and can be assigned to one instance, work across availability zones
- instances tags
- in SecurityGroups of EC2 you can set IPs as instance ID
- EC2 security guide - http://aws.amazon.com/articles/Amazon-EC2/9001172542712674
- EC2 root device guide - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/RootDeviceStorage.html
- instances can have termination protection in order to prevent accidental deletion
- *Spot Instances for EC2*
    - best suited for distributed fault-tolerant takss
    - name your price for EC2 instances
    - price varies in real time, by the hour, last hour is not charged if instance is terminated
    - instances may not start immediately
    - you need to place a spot instance request - valid dates / type one-time or persistent / launch group / AZ group
    - if you bid .25 and the price will be .23 for the period, you will pay the lower amount, if it goes over your instance stops
    - there is a Spot Instance Price History for the past 90 days
    - one-time request remains active until instance terminates, request expires, or request is cancelled
        - persistent requests remain active until expired or cancelled
    - in the last step of the request you can see current prices depending on the AZ selected
- windows host + iis  169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/mac
- Security Groups
    - if your Security Groups are not in a VPC, you're using EC2 classic
    - "all things" are accessible through the API, e.g. get security groups, VPC id, instances where applied, all rules IN/OUT for a SecGroup
    - for example, with the SDK for various programming languages we can create a simple dashboard to monitor all the VPCs and SecGroups
- Docker can be installed and is compatible w/ all Amazon Linux instances
    - docker and git need to be installed
    - docker pull jboss/wildfly; docker images - to see available ones; docker run -it --rm jboss/wildfly # run interactive remove at end
    - docker build --tag=name_assigned; we can upload files to a "location" which we later can re-build and package in the container

#### CloudFront
- content delivery web service, accelerated delivery of content through Amazon edge locations
    - no minimum usage restrictions
    - dynamic, static, streaming content
    - default allows users to access objects through HTTP and HTTPS
    - cache for location for 24 hours
    - after creating a distribution you might need to wait up to 15 minutes while its status will be DEPLOYED
- as everything is cached, if you need to update various files, one idea would be to have the files versioned (e.g. _v2)
    - if a file is changed CloudFront will still serve the cached version up to 1 day
    - to invalidate the cache, in the Distribution Settings we can create a new Invalidations and specify the files we've (we're) updated(-ing)
- CNAME can be added, up to 10 CNAMEs per distribution so you can use domain names e.g. www.mysite.com instead of .....amazonaws.com/
- default root (e.g. index.html) is the main path if none is specified
- you can select the region limits where your content is accessible

#### CodeDeploy
- automates code deploy to EC2 instances
- launch, control, and monitor instances for each instance running in a DTAP environment
- no additional charge for CodeDeploy
    - for the sample application the CloudFormation tool is used

#### AWS Trusted Advisor
- Best practices of security are in-built: VPC, IAM, network ACLs, ... and T.A. offers over 30 checks to monitor and improve security
    - Cost optimization
    - Security
    - Fault tolerance
    - Performance improvement
- 4 of the best practices are free to all customers, to have access to full 37 Business or Enterprise support is needed
    - service limits for resources that are 80% utilized
    - access unrestricted (e.g. 0.0.0.0/0) to specific hosts
    - MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) on Root account
- remove rules which allow access unrestricted to hosts and/or ports (e.g. port 21 FTP)
    - link will take you directly to Security Groups
- analysis (refresh) can be performed every 5 minutes - hovering will give you time to next refresh
- trusted weekly notification over email can be configured in Preferences of Trusted Advisor

#### Amazon Elastic Transcoder
- media transcoding in the cloud
- HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) streaming can adapt to the network speed
- pipeline to transcode a file
- a master playlist can be created which will contain all streams, depending on the bitrate the best will be selected
- depending on the S3 bucket location (upload/download) and the cloudfront location we can obtain the full path to our files (used for testing mainly)

#### CloudWatch
- monitoring (ELB) dashboard
- details about zones, and request types
- we can create an Alarm in CloudWatch that triggers an event in the auto-scale group

#### S3 (Simple Storage System)
- secure, durable, highly scalable object storage
- charged is done based on storage and requests of data (in and out), not on bucket(s) creation
- name of bucket *must be unique across all S3 buckets* (really?!?)
- backup and storage, media and app hosting, high traffic hosting
- data is represented as Objects in Buckets
    - object = file + metadata
    - one or more buckets in the system
    - access control to buckets, access logs and regions can be configured/set
- Permissions can be set as JSON (not very convenient, but there are some examples)
    - by default all objects/buckets are private
- Static Website Hosting (endpoint - Endpoint: webapplication-site-9988.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)
- Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    - for JS, "wide array of configrations options"
- to be readable by everyone you will need to have Everyone - List as Add more permissions

#### EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- persistent network attached storage, independent from the instance itself
- automatically replicated in the same Availability Zone (AZ)
- snapshotting is possible, with the snapshots saved in S3
- IOPS
    - can be provisioned
    - bursty for non-provisioned ones (default)
- for pre-existing images for AMIs a volume is created from a snapshot of the OS image
- on AMIs termination they can be saved or discarded (default behavior)
- volumes w/ sizes between 1GB to 1TB can be created
    - create, attach (to instances)
    - volumes can have tags
- Snapshots
    - create from a running instance
    - for DB we should use a read replica, for which writes are temporarily suspended to improve snapshotting speeds
    - new volumes can be created directly from existing snapshots

#### EMR (Elastic Map-Reduce) - intro youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhj3fOdt7zo
- process large amounts of data w/o managing instances
- launch & scale Hadoop applications using EC2 & S3
    - Apache Hive, Pig, Pig Latin support, most known Hadoop apps are directly available
- EC2 images are preconfigured
- Master the node which distributes jobs to other nodes
    - worker nodes
- Metrics about jobs can be viewed in CloudWatch
- cluster can be terminated on job completion
- wordSplitter.py for MR AWS file
- input and output (including logs) must be saved to S3, or be provisioned from S3
    - worker jobs can be as well from S3

#### ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)
- distributes traffic against multiple instances and multiple zones, automatically switching between all options
- works with VPC, you can create an internal LB environment for your internal network within the VPC
- integrated certificate management for SSL

#### EBS (Elastic Bean Stalk)
- deploy quickly web applications w/o knowledge of pieces required for cloud
    - monitoring, auto-scaling, load balancing all handled by EBS
    - no charge for EBS, you pay the resources that you're using
- various options to select the extras needed
    - web server - preconfigured options for most major platforms (Ruby, python, node.js, ...)
    - database server (RDS DB) - engine selection from MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle
        - instance type and database size
- next step is that all necessary AWS services are started and configured to support your environment

#### IAM
- Security Groups
    - virtual firewall fo in&out traffic
        - you can specify allow rules but not deny rules
        - by default no inbound traffic is allowed
    - Bastion server
        - single server which has access, with all other resources and applications removed for extra security
- in the VPC you can use both
    - SecurityGroups as well as - on the VPC portal
    - ACL (Access Control Lists) - Network ACLs
- Groups
- Users
    - Permissions
- users login - https://<main-id>.signin.aws.amazon.com

#### CloudTrail
- web service that records AWS API calls
    - source, destination, parameters, also made via Web, SDK, CLI, etc
    - you can easily get the history of all calls for security analysis, in order to track changes to AWS resources, or for a compliance trail
    - you can see the trail in S3 buckets

#### DynamoDB
- NoSQL, single-digit millisecond latency, document or key-value store

#### SQS (Simple Queue Service)
- fully managed message queing service
- any level of data, at any throughput w/o losing anything

#### Route 53
- Highly available and scalable DNS
    - CNAME or Canonical Name is a resource record used to specify that a domain is an alias for another domain, the canonical domain
    - having a DNS failover means that traffic always is routed to the live application, also notifications can be sent when issues occur
- monitors health and performance of your web application and other resources
- Route 53 can route internet traffic between multiple services performing same functions only to the healthy ones (email servers, web servers)
- automatically creates a NS (Name Server) resource when creating a new Hosted Zone (HZ)
    - HZ = collection a resource records sets hosted by Route 53
    - NS + SOA required for the HZ to work correctly
- if the HZ is created, you can add (Create Record Set) pointing to an Elastic IP from an existing EC2 instance
- in the Health Check we can create notifications sent to SNS
- we can create a WWW Failover alias which takes content from pre-populated S3 messages (already available, no creation needed)
    - main A alias must be set as Failover primary

#### SNS (Simple Notification Service)
- fully managed push notification service
    - push to devices, Windows, mobile, Baidu cloud, sms text, email, http to any endpoint
- create topic / email / create subscription - on ARN
- Topic ARN is necessary to manage it from the CLI tools
- to see all notifications `as-describe-notification-configurations`
- to update notifications for this LB group `as-put-notificaation-configuration`
    - we will need the identifier -> arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:22549:lab-as-topic
    - as-put-notification-configuration lab-as-group --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:22549:lab-as-topic --notification-types autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCH, autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATE

#### Device Farm
- app testing service for iOS, Android and FireOS including PhoneGap, Xamarin, Titanium, Unity
    - Android support: Appium, Calabash, Instrumentation, UI Automator, Explorer
    - iOS: Appium, Calabash, UI Automation, XCTest (including KIF)
    - built-in fuzz test, random events
- Integrated w/ CloudTrail, a service that captures API calls made to AWS and delivers logs to S3 buckets
    - radios settings can be defined (WiFi, BT, NFC) and location + "other data" can be set

#### ECS (EC2 Container Service)
- shared state, optimistic concurrency
- An Amazon ECS cluster is a regional grouping of one or more container instances on which you can run task requests.
    - Each account receives a default cluster the first time you use the Amazon ECS service.
    - Clusters may contain more than one Amazon EC2 instance type.
- Task definitions specify the container information for your application
    - such as how many containers are part of your task
    - what resources they will use
    - how they are linked together
    - which host ports they will use
- the LB is an ELB instance from EC2 dashboard

#### CloudFormation
- create a stack of applications, from a JSON file that we can store in S3
    - can be easily managed in source control
    - collection of related AWS resources (stack), provisioning and updating them
    - QueueWatcherCount can be set to >0, so we can monitor the actions done by CloudFormation
    - only mandatory element is the Resources object, which must declare at least one resource
    - Events lower tab we can see the progress of the current actions/operations
- Resources tab in the lower part shows the queues it uses/publishes to and policies
- many resources have meaningful default values, so only if we need specific changes we should update them in the JSON file
- Some examples of possible actions from the template file
    - install yum packages
    - create files, whilst specifying the contents inside the JSON template file
        - set file permissions, owner, groups
    - starting and enabling services
    - specify IAM user profiles and access
    - any property that supports updating, can be updated on subsequent runs
    - some values can be defined as parameters (e.g. instance type t2/m1/...) and can be chosen during the stack creation/update
    - we can add a WaitCondition in order to pause the stack creation until some actions are taken/time has passed
- for Mutable changes, AWS will update the underlying resource, for Immutable changes new resources will be created and then the old ones will be deleted
- we can also add properties that were not initially specified, such as SSH key-pair, and open the SecGroup to allow for SSH connections
    - for example we can update from a single LAMP server to a auto-scaling, load balanced multi host site just by updating the CloudFormation template
- in case something goes wrong, or not all configurations are correct, the changes will be automatically rolled back
- Sample templates depending on AZ - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-sample-templates.html
https://us-east-1-aws-training.s3.amazonaws.com/self-paced-lab-10/CloudFormation-WebApp-v2.template

#### Amazon ElasiCache
- In-memory caching web service, supports Memcached and Redis
- configure the EC2 so that is allows the cache cluster to connect to it
    - add it to the SecGroup that your instances are running

#### Amazon OpsWorks
- select the type of application stack you wish to use Chef 11 or Chef 12 are available
- Chef based stack deployments
- Add Stack -> Add 1 or more Layers -> Add 1 or more Instances (EC2 w/ IAM as chef-ec2) -> Add 1 or more Apps (depending on Layers)

#### Amazon RDS (Relational Data Service)
- setup a relational db (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL)

#### Amazon Redshift
- peta-byte scale datawarehouse
    - working with a cluster of nodes, parallel processing and columnar storage
    - 4 node types, 2 small and 2 large, SSD or spinning disks, max storage between 5TB to 2PB

#### SQS (Simple Queue Service)
- in actions of a particular queue we can see or delete messages (View/Delete messages), but while we're doing this no other applications have access to this queue
- various services (can) push messages to SQS/SNS so we can use them to register or track actions in AWS
- push notifications from SNS to SQS to be stored, later retrieved or analyzed

#### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- can create logically isolated AWS networking section w/ servers w/ or w/o internet access, own set of IP addresses and ranges
- when using the VPC wizard to create a VPC, we can use a NAT host for NAT-ing
- when launching EC2 instances we can assign them automatically to internal IP range and VPC
- best practice - mirror environment across 2 zones and add ELB to balance between them
- permits inbound and outbound rules for filtering traffic
    - Network ACLs are very expensive from a performance point of view
    - rules can be added to restrict also security groups
- creation of route tables and subnets can be performed from the left hand menus
    - by default the subnets don't have internet acces, safety first principle
- in SecurityGroups of EC2 you can set IPs as instance ID
- Bastion servers sit between the public internet and the private VPC, act as entrance point to the VPC or private network
    - m1.small should serve all but the largest networks, also no SSH-ing into this instance, on error just replace
- JSON
    - Mappings section; allows you to re-use the same template in all AZ, selecting only the required server types
    - VPC section: define the VPC address
        - here you need to specify the InternetGateway which will allow internet connectivity, AttachGateway
        - next specify the subnets (Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet), by referring (Ref) to the VPC we defined previously
        - routing tables (AWS::EC2::RouteTable): one for the public and one for the private networks, there can be up to 1 per subnet
            - we will specify the NAT server as router for the private section
            - next, we associate the subnets w/ the routing tables
        - next create Network ACLs (::PublicSubnetAcl and ::NetworkAcl) and then add the rules for ACLs
            - one pair ingress + egress, at least one pair needed
        - associate ACLs w/ subnets
    - create a NAT server (is a virtual EC2 appliance, we specified before)
        - to describe it we can specify REFerences to the Mappings we described in the JSON, e.g. Fn::FindInMap
        - NAT needs public (Elastic IP) to communicate w/ the Internet
        - define a NAT security group in order to specify which ports are opened or closed
        - also a private security group for communication inside the private Network
    - add an Output section
- to delete the stack we need to DISABLE termination protection in the EC2 for the NAT instance

#### CodeCommit
- create secure repositories for sharing code in the cloud :)
- Create triggers that will send an email or connect to a webhook through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
    - or run your custom integrations through AWS Lambda
- using AWS IAM, storage is S3 and DynamoDB
- unlimited repos and files


### Advanced topics

#### Auto Scaling
- the policy consits of
    - a launch configuration (AMI, instance type, security group) and
    - an auto scaling group (min/max numbers, AZ, ELB)
- the triggers can be done by CloudWatch, manually or on a schedule
- all costs are per hour, so one should pull up/down instances quickly
- exact params for as-launch are:
    - AMI image ID
    - Instance type
    - Key pair generated
    - Name of Security Group
    - launch config file
    - `ec2-metadata -z` (zone)
        - lots of other informations can be gathered using this tool
    - extra credentials are needed for authentication of the load balancer commands
    - create AS groups w/ `as-create-auto-scaling-group`
    - create launch config w/ `s-create-launch-config`
- we can also create the same config from the AWS CLI
    - `aws create-launch-configuration .... `
        - if we start spot instances, we need to specify the needed spot price `aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration ... --spot-price 0.03`
        - --min-size A --max-size B or we can specify the number of always active instances w/ --desired-capacity
    - check if creation was successful w/ `aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations `
    - auto-scaling groups can be queried w/ `aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups`
        - metrics can be aggregated on group level and sent to CloudWatch that way
- auto-scaling instances are launched without names
    - can be tagged with `as-create-or-update-tags`
- AS will be integrated with ELB, and you can get notifications from SNS (Simple Notification Service) on changes
    - see details in SNS below
- we can create a scale up/down policy
    - as-put-scaling-policy lab-scale-up-policy --auto-scaling-group lab-as-group --adjustment=1 --type ChangeInCapacity --cooldown 300
    - as-put-scaling-policy lab-scale-down-policy --auto-scaling-group lab-as-group "--adjustment=-1" --type ChangeInCapacity --cooldown 300
    - to stop to AS group, we can set the capacity to 0 (zero)
    - we can set a CloudWatch alarm in which the sum of all instances in instance hours surpasses a threshold, the auto-scaled instances are terminated
        - also an email is sent to a list of addresses :)
- we can create an Alarm in CloudWatch that triggers an event in the auto-scale group
- all scaling can be analyzed by using `as-describe-scaling-activities --show-long`
- all autoscaling processes can be suspended/resumed w/ `as-supend/resume-...`
- quick reference card for Auto Scaling - http://awsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/AutoScaling/latest/as-qrc.pdf

#### Dynamic Registration
- Elastic environment - is highly utilized all the time, by using just in time provisioning
    - add instances as some metric increases (e.g. CPU), remove them when decreasing
- Scalable architecture - on-demand elastic growth w/o changing of architecture
    - Horizontal scaling: add/remove same size instances
- Bootstraping: automatically configure the instance on boot
    - by accessing already available and accessible meta-data
    - one such tool is CloudInit from Canonical/Ubuntu
    - CloudFormation: create and delete AWS (instances, AS groups, DynamoDB, etc) called stacks by using a JSON template
        - stacks can be used to create/update existing stacks
