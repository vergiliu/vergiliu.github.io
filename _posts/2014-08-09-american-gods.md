In the rather interesting and much acclaimed book `American Gods`  the author touches on many interesting ideas about old and new gods.
As this was a let's call it "special edition" of the book, or the "author's favorite" I was expecting a bit more of Gaiman's spice sprinkled throughout the book, but that I was in my opinion where the book felt short.
Overall it had a somewhat slower pace, or maybe it was only as a consequence of being a bit longer due to the special version, but I didn't find it as cool as others have.

Rating 3/5

As usual, you can find the book on [Amazon] or [Goodreads], if you're looking for more information or a place to get a grab of one copy.
