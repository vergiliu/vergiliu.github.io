1. Starting Strength :)
2. Scala 
##### Week1
- function definition `def functionName(variable: Type): ReturnType = { /*function content*/}`
- call by name vs call by value
- blocks can be used by specifying code inside {}
- tail recursion: a function stack space can be reused, if it calls itself as last action - constant stack frame
    - use @tailrec
