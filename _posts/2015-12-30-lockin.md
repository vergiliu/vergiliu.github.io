A terrible disease that causes the brain to become sort of disconnected from the body causing the lock in - meaning "you cannot move but just the brains work as usual".
Some are using some robot bodies in order to do their daily tasks, but they can also hire a couple of special guys called integrators, where another person "drives" a person's body.
Some cool sci-fi detective spin follows and a nice and cozy beach read away.
