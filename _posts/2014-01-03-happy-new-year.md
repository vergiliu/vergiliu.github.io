First of all, Happy New Year to everyone.

Next book is a great incursion into the challenges big companies face when disruptive technologies and companies get into the markets of existing players. By trying to cover a lower end of the market with lower returns they slowly move up the market getting to take out profits from the upper class market players. Examples cover the somewhat fast moving disk drives industries going from 14" to 8", 5.25", 3.25" or from excavators or motorcycle disruptors. 
Check out the link [on Amazon] for more info on how to get the book.
