_Spoiler alert - careful as I might reveal something about the turn of the story or of the characters._

As maybe most (or all of?) the books which I really like a lot, it feels that Wool starts a bit slow.
Maybe as I wise up, I get that as the author takes the time to set the stage better and build up the characters and atmosphere of the place and time, you get better rewards throughout the book as you try to better grasp the situation and locations.
As the world's population seems to have disappeared - at least at the surface - people live in an underground structure called a silo, which contains not only sleeping quarters and entertainment areas but everything else in between - that means a power station, a very generous IT department, food producing and of course a hospital.
It seems the only downside of living below ground, is that for any major crime you get sent to clean up the cameras keeping an eye on the bad environment outside - and from that no-one seems to be returning.

After about the first quarter of the book, which felt slow, the pace is picking up and keeping it up to the end of the book. You (or at least I) just can't put it down without wondering what will happen next, or what will the sherif do.
Awesome book overall touching on a few points of living in confined spaces (or at least that feel confined) and the dependence of the people holding the (true) information.
I'm really looking forward to the other books in the series.

One cool thing, in [iTunes], at least at the time of this review, the book seems to be free to read.
