Part 1 / Chapter 1

- Challenges encountered as soon as infra grows, and initial hurdle of introducing automation appears
    - server sprawl: infrastructure gets too big, or too big too quickly
    - snowflake server (pets vs cattle):  when too much time was invested into "tuning" a particular host
    - configuration drift: updates, patches, hand tuning
    - automation fear: get pass the initial moment of using automation just for provisioning
- Fixes
    - Systems are easily re-created and created always the same
    - Start with a automation/scripting first approach, instead of the other way around
    - Use definition files (recipes for Chef, and so on...)
    - Make the process self-documenting (going as far as auto-creating a paper trail if needed)
    - Store everything in version control, and do small changes instead of big-bang migrations
    - Antifragility - use MTTR instead of MTBF, as there will always be failures
        - this part is really in-tune with the Google SRE approach to all (possible) issues
