Part 1 / Chapter 1

- Challenges encountered as soon as infra grows, and initial hurdle of introducing automation appears
    - server sprawl: infrastructure gets too big, or too big too quickly
    - snowflake server (pets vs cattle):  when too much time was invested into "tuning" a particular host
    - configuration drift: updates, patches, hand tuning
    - automation fear: get pass the initial moment of using automation just for provisioning
- Fixes
    - Systems are easily re-created and created always the same
    - Start with a automation/scripting first approach, instead of the other way around
    - Use definition files (recipes for Chef, and so on...)
    - Make the process self-documenting (going as far as auto-creating a paper trail if needed)
    - Store everything in version control, and do small changes instead of big-bang migrations
    - Antifragility - use MTTR instead of MTBF, as there will always be failures
        - this part is really in-tune with the Google SRE approach to all (possible) issues

Chapter 2
- The dynamic infra should be automated, not necessarily virtualized
- solution should be: programmable, on-demand, and with self-service; otherwise it cannot be considered as a valid platform
    - "hand-cranked cloud" is not a cloud
    - bare-metal "cloud" is possible
- Storage should provide: block, and object storage (think S3)
- Cloud portability should be taken into account if deciding on a public cloud platform

Chapter 3 - Infra definition tools / Chapter 4 - Server configuration tools
- everything should be scriptable/automatable otherwise we can't consider it as a mature software offering
- all "steps" of the automation should be idempotent, with validation performed before and after the fact
- configuration should be external of the tool(s) used, and stored in a version control system (e.g. git)
- the CMDB is tied to the "iron age" and not the "cloud age"
    - infrastructure should be in an ever-updating "database", it should not be checked to conform to the initial design
- _all changes should be done routinely, reliably, and safely_
- tools should be used to apply the right configuration/updates to selected pools of servers
    - Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, CFEngine
    - running commands on multiple servers should be done as a quick fix, and not as day-to-day operations
- Containers are not VMs :)
    - extra care needs to be taken into account when selecting containers; e.g. using internal images repos instead of open ones

Chapter 5 - General infra services
- continously test tools, changes, and procedures so you gain confidence in your infra and tools
- alerting should warn in time or trigger actionable items
    - displaying CPU/memory graphs is not a "information radiator"
    - clear red/green "radiators" are much more helpful from the perspective of something is on fire and needs to be put out

Chapter 6 -
- server provisioning can be approached in multiple ways:
    - always deploy bare OS and later add required tools/apps as updates
    - always deploy your required tools / apps packaged in the image, and re-create on updates/deployments
- take care of data or logs which might need to be saved before the destruction of the instance
