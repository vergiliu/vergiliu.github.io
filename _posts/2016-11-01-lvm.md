Logical Volume Manager
- disks or partitions are managed as Physical Volumes (PV)
    - `pvcreate /dev/xda1`
    - `lvmdiskscan` to identify all items which can be used as PVs
    - resize/remove the PVs w/ `pvresize or pvremove`
- more PVs can be merged/striped into Volume Group (VG)
    - `vgcreate volgrp1 /dev/sdd1`
    - adding PVs to VGs `vgextend volgrp1 /dev/sde1`
    - `vgmerge / vgsplit`
- more VGs can be merged into Logical Volumes (LV) - their size is considered in minimal extensible chunks, or extents
- LVs can be thin-provisioned, appearing as more available space than actual space due to sharing between clients
- SSDs can be used as cache for spinning disks
- clustering can be managed by the Clustered Logical Volume Manager (CLVM)

- LVs commands:
    - `lvcreate -L 10G volgrp1` create liniar 10G volume
    - `lvcreate -L 10G -i 2 -n stripedvol volgrp1` create striped 10G volume, number of stripes=2, name=stripedvol, default stripe size is 64KB
    - -m # of copies for RAID1
    - -i # of stripes for RAID 4/5/6
    - recovery rate can be throttled
- RAID 1/4/5/6/10
