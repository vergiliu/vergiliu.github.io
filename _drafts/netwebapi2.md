ASP.NET WEB API
Hypermedia as the engine of application state - HATE OAS - key to RESTfulness of the service

- the server dictates all (relationships, URI, all forms) you need no prior knowledge
- PUT create or replace a resource (tasks)
- POST new resource identifier (create task)
- GET all (tasks)
- DELETE all (tasks)

GET, PUT, DELETE - idempotent - calling them over and over will produce same result
# page 15 - describing task vs. taskInfo
# page 17 - http status codes
