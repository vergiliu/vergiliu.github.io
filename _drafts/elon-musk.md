`Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance`

Ch3 - Elon seems to really get into his element once he's able to emigrate to Canada, where he starts going to college.
Later he gets a scholarship and moves to US. What's already impressive, confirmed by himself as well as others is that his initial ideas are just becoming clearer and not making them along -
that is space, solar, and batteries are still his go-to things to innovate, and even though he likes computer games, he doesn't see that as world-changing.
Ch4 - We start to see Musk focus and determination, while trying to get his startup off the ground. Apparently he is pulling all nighters in coding while trying to make sort of mash-up between the now Google Maps and the Yellow Pages. His company already has big ideas and is trying to poach big names from SGI.
