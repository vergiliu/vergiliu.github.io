`Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance`

Ch3 - Elon seems to really get into his element once he's able to emigrate to Canada, where he starts going to college.
Later he gets a scholarship and moves to US. What's already impressive, confirmed by himself as well as others is that his initial ideas are just becoming clearer and not making them along -
that is space, solar, and batteries are still his go-to things to innovate, and even though he likes computer games, he doesn't see that as world-changing.
