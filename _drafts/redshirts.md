`Redshirts by John Scalzi`

Taking a untested path in scifi writing Scalzi is going wild in this short novel about... space, and TV-series?!?
What I would say is unexpected is that the faith of the characters seems to be dictated by some alien forces, which ironically in this case are an old fiction TV series.
Lots of references to Star Trek and the first science based series and a lot of fun to read, even though it falls short of being a great fiction book.
I would still recommend it, nonetheless, for the easy and short read and overall funny writing style.

Rating 3/5
