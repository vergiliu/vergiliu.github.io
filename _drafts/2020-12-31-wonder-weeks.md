Lots of excellent knowledge about (first time) parents, some tips and tricks, some checklists and activities some excellent resources inside the (app and) book.

But.... WAY. TOO. LONG. 

It's just repetitive to no avail. I feel that the "pocket" version of this book could be way less off-putting to lots of readers and still have the same usefulness in content and activities, if not better, at 30% of the current size.

It is many times reassuring that other babies and toddlers have similar issues, problems and break-downs as all of us, but you don't need to have an example of every. possible. kid. in. the. book... Just sayin', make it shorter and to the point.
