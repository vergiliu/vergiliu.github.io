###The Lean Startup by [jan2013-may2013]
+ Going after a couple of ideas of what make a startup tick, and how can you avoid falling in the most common pitfalls of the startup movement.
+ Talking about `validated learning' where all the steps you take are directed by input coming from the customers and not from the business owners. A couple of examples presented like the IMVU service, the laundry in India, or Kodak photo share which all started with a basic product, and improving that by getting input from customers instead of having a plan before going to market.
- MVP description and what’s it about. Always strive to keep the feature creep to a minimum and deliver to the early adopters, whom are people to prefer somewhat incomplete products just to gain the incentive of being first users - which might be an advantage to them or their company  by being first batch of users.
- The leap-of-faith assumption refers to one thing that the startup assumes to be correct without prior validation, but in which the MVP helps to make a sale.
The Dropbox example where a “how does it work” video became the MVP that went through the features - sync made easy - but at the same time the leap-of-faith was the assumption that similar products where too difficult to use.
- Food on the table story - “concierge” approach - one customer initially interacted directly with the founder in order to get an insight in building the product.
- Use the so called "Innovation accounting" for the startup as an accounting method
