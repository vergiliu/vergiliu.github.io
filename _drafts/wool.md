`Wool Omnibus (Silo series 1 out of 3) - by Hugh Howley`

_Spoiler alert - careful as I might reveal something about the turn of the story or of the characters._

As maybe most (or all of?) the books which I really like a lot, it feels that Wool starts a bit slow.
Maybe as I wise up, I get that as the author takes the time to set the stage better and build up the characters and atmosphere of the place and time, you get better rewards throughout the book as you try to better grasp the situation and locations.
As the world's population seems to have disappeared - at least at the surface - people live in an underground structure called a silo, which contains not only sleeping quarters and entertainment areas but everything else in between - that means a power station, a very generous IT department, food producing and of course a hospital.
It seems the only downside of living below ground, is that for any major crime you get sent to clean up the cameras keeping an eye on the bad environment outside - and from that no-one seems to be returning



One cool thing, in [iTunes], at least at this time, the book seems to be free to read.

Rating 5/5
