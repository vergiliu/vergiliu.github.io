Ch5 - Deployment pipeline
- Process can be seen as a value stream map -> fundamentlly an automated software delivery process
- Build source only once
- Keep configuration(s) separately from code
- deploy using the same process in all environments
- if any part of the pipeline fails, stop the line
- my pet peeve, the pipeline, is actually referring to the CPU pipeline, which is somewhat different but hey not anybody can like it, right?
- we should handle as much as possible in an automated fashion, esp. wrt to the host and environment configuration
