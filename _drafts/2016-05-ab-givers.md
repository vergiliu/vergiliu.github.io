#### Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach

In this book the author is trying to go convene to us information about some psychology and the types of people matching to those profiles he will describe.
First of all there are three types of people that he divides all people into: the givers, the takers, and the matchers.
Even the low on first sight we would say that the takers are the most successful of the tree on closer inspection we can see that actually neither the the takers nor the matchers are, but the most successful of the group remain the givers.
He then goes on describing many situations, either staged during trials or actual, in order to re-enforce that idea.
