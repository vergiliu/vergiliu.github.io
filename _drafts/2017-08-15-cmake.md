#### chapters 1-2

- cmake-gui or ccmake (curses lib version) can be run to update configurations

#### chapter 3

generators
- global per project generator
- every folder has a local generator for creating Makefiles
- each in turn will create content based on CMakeLists

targets
- stored in cmMakefile; e.g. _add_library_, _add_executable_
- `add_library (foo STATIC foo.c)`: _foo_ can be used in the CML later
- can keep track of general properties w/ `set_target_properties` and `get_target_property`

commands
- generic `set|get_property` commands

- all variables defined have visibility in the following scope and well as in children of the current scope
    - we can explicitly set variables with _PARENT_SCOPE_ if required: `set (foo 1 PARENT_SCOPE)`
- user selections and options are cached
    - we can explicitly define vars in the cache, but their type need to be specified: `set (USE_JPEG ON CACHE BOOL "include jpeg?")`
