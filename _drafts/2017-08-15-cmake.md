#### chapters 1-2

- cmake-gui or ccmake (curses lib version) can be run to update configurations

#### chapter 3

generators
- global per project generator
- every folder has a local generator for creating Makefiles
- each in turn will create content based on CMakeLists

targets
- stored in cmMakefile; e.g. _add_library_, _add_executable_
- `add_library (foo STATIC foo.c)`: _foo_ can be used in the CML later
- can keep track of general properties w/ `set_target_properties` and `get_target_property`

commands
- generic `set|get_property` commands
- all variables defined have visibility in the following scope and well as in children of the current scope
    - we can explicitly set variables with _PARENT_SCOPE_ if required: `set (foo 1 PARENT_SCOPE)`
- user selections and options are cached
    - we can explicitly define vars in the cache, but their type need to be specified: `set (USE_JPEG ON CACHE BOOL "include jpeg?")`

#### chapter 4

- `project`: if CXX enabled, C is included as well
- `set` / `remove` / `separate_arguments` - input a string containing multiple space separated values, outputs a list
- `if` can either have the condition specified everywhere - strings must remain the same - or all others can have just empty conditions
- possible operations in the check: `NOT`, `AND`, `OR`, `DEFINED`, `MATCHES`, `EQUAL`, `LESS`, `STREQUAL`, ..., `VERSION_GREATER`

```
if (FOO)   
    # do something
else (FOO)     # or else ()
# elseif (BAR) is also supported
    # something else
endif (FOO)    # or endif ()
```
- `foreach` and `while`
```
foreach (afile one two three)
    add_test(${afile}-test .... -D -V -A ...)
endforeach (afile)
```
- `macro`s are called similarly to functions, but its arguments are replaced prior to executing it
    - they can have also variable number of parameters
- we can specify minimum required version for cmake `cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8)`
- cmake modules are components which can be reused - they are located in the Modules subfolder
    - `include (moduleName)` the full path to the module can as well be provided instead
- a policy (version dependent) can be set or queried, useful on cmake version upgrades
    - policies can be silenced w/ `cmake_policy (SET CMPXXXX OLD)` or enabled w/ `... NEW)`
- system libraries can be targeted w/ the following snippet
```
find_library (M_LIB m)
target_link_libraries (my_executable ${M_LIB})
```
- shared libraries
    = entire unit is the atomic unit, this can cause issues when converting from static to shared library
    = the linking order needs to be taken into account, as linker do a single pass to search for symbols (pg 64)
    = `ldd` command to see which libraries are used by a binary
    = the linked libraries for different ".so" versions can be set by `set_target_properties`
- installing files
