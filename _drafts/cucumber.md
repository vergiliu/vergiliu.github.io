The book even if it's targeted towards the Ruby crowd is as useful for the Ruby as well as for Ruby-derived frameworks, such as Lettuce for Python or Cucumber-java for well, you know...

The first ten or so chapters have a really nice progress of testing and at a same time drafting an application that is of course focussed on Cucumber. Lots of tips as well as ways of working and avoiding common pitfalls are presented throughout the chapters.
Also throughout the book you'll find not only useful Cucumber tailored techniques but also things which apply in a continuous integration environment.

Below you can find some "might-be-useful" ideas from the book:
- Tags can be used to execute just certain scenarios
- Tagged hooks in order to run certain scenarios only on tagged steps

Rating /5
