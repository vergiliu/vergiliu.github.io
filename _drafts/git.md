Relative references:
- git branch newBranchName
- git checkout moveToThisBranch
- one can go "up the tree" w/ git checkout HEAD^ repeatedly
- git merge otherBranch, creates one merged branch from 2 different branches
- git rebase otherBranch, copies all commits from the other branch onto current branch
- detached HEAD, when doing git checkout hash1235, as we are no longer in a specific "place"
- HEAD is current place in the tree where we are
- force assignment master branch to 3 commits up using relative refs ~ operator: git branch -f master HEAD~3
- git reset HEAD^ rewrite history as there were no commits, only works on local commits
- git revert HEAD for remote/pushed changes
- git cherry-pick commit1/hash1 commit2/hash2 (...) selects only the commits desired
- git rebase -i , for interactive rebasing, squash commits means merging them into 1, pick means dropping the commits
- git commit --amend to update the commit message
- git tag tagName hash/branch, to freeze in time the git repo state
- git describe reference, to see information about the commits state
